Term Definition Connection A communication link between two devices, such as between a controller and an I/O module, PanelView terminal, or another controller. Connections are allocations of resources that provide more reliable communication between devices than unconnected messages. The number of connections that a single controller can have is limited. You indirectly determine the number of connections the controller uses by conf iguring the controller to communicate with other devices in the system. These communication types use connections:•I/O modules •Produced and consumed tags •Certain types of Message (MSG) instruct ions (not all types use a connection) Requested packet interval (RPI)The RPI specifies the period at which data updates over a connection. For example, an input module sends data to a controller at the RPI that you assign to the module. •Typically, you configure an RPI in milliseconds (ms). The range is 0.2 ms (200 microseconds)…750 ms. •If a ControlNet network connects the devices, the RPI reserves a slot in the stream of data flowing across the ControlNet network. The timing of this slot may not coinci de with the exact value of the RPI, but the control system guarantees that the data transfers at least as']","In a Logix5000 controller, connections are used for I/O modules, produced and consumed tags, certain types of Message (MSG) instructions, and Requested packet interval (RPI).",simple,"[{'source': 'pdf\\Logix5000_Controllers_Information_and_Status.pdf', 'page': 57, 'chunk_id': 'pdf\\Logix5000_Controllers_Information_and_Status.pdf_57_12'}]",True
