Section Ill. Hazards Identification.

Potential Health Contact can cause slight irritation of skin, eyes and respiratory tract. Extremely dangerous in case of ingestion. For more Effects information, refer to Section 11.

Section IV. First Aid Measures

Eye Contact IMMEDIATELY flush eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes, keeping eyelids open. Seek medical attention.

Skin Contact Remove contaminated clothing - launder before reuse. Wash gently and thoroughly the contaminated skin with running water and non-abrasive soap. Seek medical attention.

Inhalation Evacuate the victim to a safe area as soon as possible. If the victim is not breathing, perform artificial respiration. Allow the victim to rest in a well ventilated area. Seek medical attention.

Ingestion DO NOT induce vomiting because of danger of aspirating liquid into lungs. Seek medical attention.

Flash Points Closed Cup: 116°C (Tagliabue) Auto-Ignition 413°C Open Cup: 116°C (Cleveland) Temperature

Fire Hazards in Combustible in presence of open flames and | Explosion Hazards Not a product presenting risks of explosion. Presence of sparks. in Presence of Various Substances Various Substances

Products of Carbon oxides (CO, CO2), smoke and irritating vapours as products of incomplete combustion. Combustion

Fire Fighting SMALL FIRE: Use DRY chemicals, CO2, water spray or foam. Media and LARGE FIRE: Use water spray, fog or foam. DO NOT use water jet. Instructions

Section VI. Accidental Release Measures

Material Release or Spill

Small spill or leak: Dilute with water and mop up or absorb with an inert DRY material and place in an appropriate waste disposal container.

Large spill or leak: Absorb with an inert material and put the spilled material in an appropriate waste disposal. Dispose of in accordance with regional regulations.

Section VII. Handling and Storage

Avoid contamination with reactive substances. After handling, always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water.

Keep container dry. Keep container tightly closed. Keep in a cool, well-ventilated place.

Section Vill. Exposure Controls/Personal Protection

Engineering Controls

For normal application, special ventilation is not necessary. If user's operations generate vapours or mist, use ventilation to keep exposure to airborne contaminants below the exposure limit. Make-up air should always be supplied to balance air removed by exhaust ventilation. Ensure that eyewash station and safety shower are close to work-station.

Personal Protection - Eyes

Body Respiratory

Hands

Feet

The selection of personal protective equipment varies, depending upon conditions of use.

Eye protection (i.e., safety glasses, safety goggles and/or face shield) should be determined based on conditions of use. If product is used in an application where splashing may occur, the use of safety goggles and/or a face shield should be considered.

Wear appropriate clothing to prevent skin contact. As a minimum long sleeves and trousers should be worn.

Where concentrations in air may exceed the occupational exposure limits given in Section 2 (and those applicable to your area) and where engineering, work practices or other means of exposure reduction are not adequate, NIOSH approved respirators may be necessary to prevent overexposure by inhalation.

Wear appropriate chemically protective gloves. When handling hot product ensure gloves are heat resistant and insulated.

Wear appropriate footwear to prevent product from coming in contact with feet and skin.
