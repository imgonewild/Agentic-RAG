If user's operations generate vapours or mist, use ventilation to keep exposure to airborne contaminants below the exposure limit. Make-up air should always be supplied to balance air removed by exhaust ventilation. Ensure that eyewash station and safety shower are close to work-station. Personal Protection - The selection of personal protective equipment varies, depending upon conditions of use.","skin contact. As a minimum long sleeves and trousers should be worn. Respiratory Where concentrations in air may exceed the occupational exposure limits given in Section 2 (and those applicable to your area) and where engineering, work practices or other means of exposure reduction are not adequate, NIOSH approved respirators may be necessary to prevent overexposure by inhalation.
