41: What are the recommended engineering controls, personal protective equipment (PPE), and respiratory protection for handling the product?
{"answer": "Special ventilation is not necessary for normal application. If vapours or mist are generated, use ventilation to keep exposure below exposure limit. Make-up air should always be supplied to balance air removed by exhaust ventilation. NIOSH approved respirators may be necessary if concentrations exceed occupational exposure limits.", "source": "Engineering Controls, Personal Protection"}

Engineering Controls
Personal Protection  -  The selection of personal protective equipment varies, depending upon conditions of use.For normal application, special ventilation is not necessary. If user's operations generate vapours or mist, use ventilation to
keep exposure to airborne contaminants below the exposure limit. Make-up air should always be supplied to balance air
