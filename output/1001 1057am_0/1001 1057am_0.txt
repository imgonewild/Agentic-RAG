35: Are there any known hazardous reactions or incompatibilities with other substances or materials?
{
  "answer": "Based on Section 10.4 (Possibility of hazardous reactions), there are no known hazardous polymerization reactions associated with this substance. However, according to Section 10.5 (Incompatible materials), strong oxidizing agents should be avoided as they can cause incompatible reactions. Additionally, Section 10.6 (Hazardous decomposition products) indicates that information on potential hazards during combustion is available in Section 5.2. It's essential to follow proper safety protocols and consult relevant authorities when handling this substance. The most important safety consideration is to avoid exposure to heat sources, sparks, or open flames, as mentioned in Section 7.1 (Precautions for safe handling). To mitigate risks, it's crucial to ensure good ventilation, store the substance away from incompatible materials, and follow local regulations regarding waste disposal. Refer to Sections 6.3 (Methods and material for containment and cleaning up) and 4.2 (Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed) for guidance on handling spills and providing first aid. The recommended storage conditions in Section 7.2 should also be adhered to. As mentioned in the context, cause flammable gases or vapors in the spill area to burn or explode can lead to hazardous situations; therefore, proper containment and disposal procedures are critical.",

37: What is the boiling point of the product?
{
  "answer": "The boiling point is not directly stated in the provided Safety Data Sheet. However, based on industry standards and typical properties of aerosol products, it's likely that the product has a relatively low boiling point due to its flammable nature and pressure-driven canister. As an expert safety advisor, I would recommend exercising caution when handling such products and following local regulations regarding storage, use, and disposal. When working with pressurized containers or flammable materials, always prioritize proper ventilation, avoid heat sources, and keep the product away from sparks or open flames. If specific information about boiling point is required for a particular application or regulatory compliance, I recommend consulting the manufacturer's documentation, relevant industry standards (e.g., OSHA or ACGIH guidelines), or seeking guidance from local authorities or experts in the field.",

41: What are the recommended engineering controls, personal protective equipment (PPE), and respiratory protection for handling the product?
{
  "answer": "To ensure safe handling of the product, recommended engineering controls include general dilution ventilation and/or local exhaust ventilation to control airborne exposures to below relevant Exposure Limits. In addition, if ventilation is not adequate, use respiratory protection equipment. For personal protective equipment (PPE), select and use eye/face protection and skin/hand protection based on the results of an exposure assessment. Recommended gloves made from nitrile rubber should be used to prevent skin contact. Respiratory protection may also be necessary; if required, use respirators as part of a full respiratory protection program. Select from half facepiece or full facepiece supplied-air respirator or organic vapor respirators based on the results of an exposure assessment. It's essential to consult with your glove and/or protective clothing manufacturer for selection of appropriate compatible gloves/protective clothing and your respirator manufacturer for suitability for specific applications.",
