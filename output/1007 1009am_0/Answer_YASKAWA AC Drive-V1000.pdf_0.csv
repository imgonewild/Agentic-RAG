Failure to set the proper timing can result in speed loss. Not for use with conveyor, transport, or hoist type applications. • Restarting a Coasting Motor: To restart a coasting motor rotating at over 200 Hz while in the V/f control mode, use the Short Circuit Braking function to first bring the motor to a stop. Short Circuit Braking requires a special braking resistor. Contact Yaskawa or your Yaskawa agent for details. Speed Search can be used to restart a coasting motor rotating slower than 200 Hz. If the motor cable is relatively long, however, the motor should instead be stopped using Short Circuit Braking, which forces the motor to stop by creating a short-circuit in the motor windings. nApplications with Specialized Motors Multi-Pole Motor Because the rated current will differ from a standard motor, be sure to check the maximum current when selecting a drive. Always stop the motor before switching between the number of motor poles. If a regen overvoltage (oV) fault occurs or if overcurrent protection (oC) is triggered, the motor will coast to stop. Submersible Motor Because motor rated current is greater than a standard motor, select the drive capacity accordingly. Be sure to use a large enough gauge motor cable to avoid decreasing the maximum torque']","['of over 440 V or particularly long wiring distances.

Contact the motor or machine manufacturer. Torque Characteristics Torque characteristics differ compared to operating the motor directly from line power. The user should have a full understanding of the load torque characteristics for the application. Vibration and Shock The drive settings allow the user to choose between high carrier PWM control and low carrier PWM. Selecting high carrier PWM can help reduce motor oscillation. Take particular caution when using a variable speed drive for an application that is conventionally run from line power at a constant speed. If mechanical resonance occurs, install shock-absorbing rubber around the base of the motor and enable the Jump frequency selection parameter to prevent continuous operation in the resonant frequency range. Audible Noise Noise created during run varies by the carrier frequency setting. When using a high carrier frequency, audible noise from the motor is comparable to the motor noise generated when running from line power. Operating above the rated r/min, however, can create unpleasant motor noise. nUsing a Synchronous Motor • Synchronous motors cannot be']","['proper direction. • The motor should accelerate and decelerate smoothly. nOperating the Motor under Loaded Conditions Test run the application similarly to the no-load test procedure when connecting the machinery to the motor. • Check monitor parameter U1-03 to ensure there is no overcurrent. • If the application permits running the load in the reverse direction, try changing motor direction and the frequency reference while watching for abnormal motor oscillation or vibration. • Correct any problems that occurs with hunting, oscillation, or other control-related issues.4.9 Test Run with Load Connected YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual 1094Start-Up Programming & Operation4.10 Verifying Parameter Settings and Backing Up Changes Check changes to parameter settings as a result of Auto-Tuning using the Verify function.

Failure to comply could lead to motor winding failure. Motor vibration may increase when operating a machine in variable-speed mode, if that machine previously operated at a constant speed. Install vibration-proof rubber on the motor base or use the frequency jump function to skip a frequency resonating the machine. The motor may require more acceleration torque with drive operation than with a commercial power supply. Set a proper V/f pattern by checking the load torque characteristics of the machine to be used with the motor. The rated input current of submersible motors is higher than the rated input current of standard motors. Select an appropriate drive according to its rated output current. When the distance between the motor and drive is long, use a cable thick enough to connect the motor to the drive to prevent motor torque reduction. When using an explosion-proof motor, it must be subject to an explosion-proof test in conjunction with the drive. This']"

The diagrams in this section may illustrate drives without covers or safety shields to display details. Be sure to reinstall covers or shields before operating the drives and run the drives according to the instructions described in this manual. Always ground the motor-side grounding terminal. Improper equipment grounding could result in death or serious injury by contacting the motor case. Do not touch terminals before the capacitors have fully discharged.

Improper application of peripheral devices could result in drive performance degradation due to improper power supply. NOTICE: Insulate shields with tape or shrink tubing to prevent contact with other signal lines and equipment. Improper wiring practices could result in drive or equipment malfunction due to short circuit. NOTICE: Connect the shield of shielded cable to the appropriate ground terminal. Improper equipment grounding could result in drive or equipment malfunction or nuisance trips. Wire the control terminals using Figure 3.20 as a guide.

Failure to comply could result in death or serious injury by fire as a result of drive damage from line voltage application to output terminals. nCable Length Between Drive and Motor When the cable length between the drive and the motor is too long (especially at low frequency output), note that the cable voltage drop may cause reduced motor torque. Drive output current will increase as the leakage current from the cable increases. An increase in leakage current may trigger an overcurrent situation and weaken the accuracy of the current detection. Adjust the drive carrier frequency according to the following table. If the motor wiring distance exceeds 100 m because of the system configuration, reduce the ground currents. Refer to C6-02: Carrier Frequency Selection on page 156 Refer to Table 3.5 to set the carrier frequency to an appropriate level.

Install a motor thermal overload relay between the drive and motor: • When operating multiple motors on a single AC drive. • When using a power line bypass to operate the motor directly from the power line. It is not necessary to install a motor thermal overload relay when operating a single motor from a single AC drive. The AC drive has UL recognized electronic motor overload protection built into the drive software. Note: Disable the motor protection function (L1-0 1 = “0”) when using an external motor thermal overload relay.

When general-purpose motors are driven by AC drives, the motor current is approximately 5 to 10% greater than if driven by the commercial power supply. In addition, the cooling capacity of a motor with a shaft-driven fan decreases when operating at low speeds. Even if the load current is within the motor rated value, motor overheating may occur. A thermal relay cannot effectively protect the motor due to the reduction of cooling at low speeds. For this reason, apply the UL recognized electronic thermal overload protection function built into the drive whenever possible. UL recognized electronic thermal overload function of the drive: Speed-dependent heat characteristics are simulated using data from standard motors and force-ventilated motors. The motor is protected from overload using this function. Using One Drive with Multiple Motors Turn off the electronic thermal overload function.

The UL recognized electronic thermal overload function of the drive cannot be applied when using multiple motors on one drive.
