Term Definition Connection A communication link between two devices, such as between a controller and an I/O module, PanelView terminal, or another controller. Connections are allocations of resources that provide more reliable communication between devices than unconnected messages. The number of connections that a single controller can have is limited. You indirectly determine the number of connections the controller uses by conf iguring the controller to communicate with other devices in the system. These communication types use connections:•I/O modules •Produced and consumed tags •Certain types of Message (MSG) instruct ions (not all types use a connection) Requested packet interval (RPI)The RPI specifies the period at which data updates over a connection. For example, an input module sends data to a controller at the RPI that you assign to the module. •Typically, you configure an RPI in milliseconds (ms). The range is 0.2 ms (200 microseconds)…750 ms. •If a ControlNet network connects the devices, the RPI reserves a slot in the stream of data flowing across the ControlNet network. The timing of this slot may not coinci de with the exact value of the RPI, but the control system guarantees that the data transfers at least as
to the CompactFlash card. Additionally, buffered entries can be automatically written before a firmware update. This is configured by sending a message instruction to the controller, using a message type of “CIP Generic” and a service type of “Controller Log Automatic W rite Set” . Sending a value of 0 will turn off automatic writes, and sending a value of 1 will turn on automatic writes. By default, entries are not automatically written. A rung of logic that performs this configuration and the configuration dialog box of the message instruction are shown below. Figure 2 - Automatic Save “Set” Ladder Instruction Automatic Save “Set” Configuration Dialog BoxTIP Some Logix controllers support additional types of removable media that can be used to write the controller log entries. Refer to the Logix controller documentation for information regarding the type of removable media your Logix controller supports.28 Rockwell Automation Publication 1756-PM015E-EN-P - November 2012Chapter 3 Controller Logging The current state of the automatic write setting can be retrieved by using a message instruction with a message type of “CIP Generic” and a service type of “Controller Log Automatic W rite Get” .

The timing of this slot may not coinci de with the exact value of the RPI, but the control system guarantees that the data transfers at least as often as the RPI. Path The path describes the route that a conn ection takes to get to the destination. Typically, you automatically define the path for a connection when you add the devices to the I/O Configuration folder of the controller.10 Rockwell Automation Publication 1756-PM015E-EN-P - November 2012Chapter 1 Connections Inhibit a ConnectionIn some situations, such as when initially commissioning a system, it is useful to disable portions of a control system and enable them as you wire the control system. The controller lets you inhibit individual modules or groups of modules, which prevents the controller from trying to communicate with the modules. When you configure an I/O module, it defaults to being not inhibited. Y ou can change an individual module’s properties to inhibit a module. When you inhibit a communication bridge module, the controller shuts down the connections to the

The SSV instruction sets the Mode attr ibute for the module = Module_1_Mode.12 Rockwell Automation Publication 1756-PM015E-EN-P - November 2012Chapter 1 Connections Manage a Connection FailureIf the controller loses communication with a module, data from that device does not update. When this occurs, the logic makes decisions on data that may or may not be correct. This section explains how to program a controller to fault. If communication with a device in the I/O configuration of the controller does not occur for 100 ms, the communication times out. If this occurs, you have these options.ATTENTION: Outputs respond to the last, non- faulted state of the controlling inputs. To avoid potential injury and damage to machinery, make sure this does not create an unsafe operation. Configure critical I/O modules to generate a controller major fault when they lose their connections to the controller: or, monitor the status of I/O modules. EXAMPLE Loss of Communication ATTENTION: Controller B requires data from controller A. If communication fails between the controllers, then controller B continues to act on the last data that it received from controller A.

This interrupts the execution of logic and executes the Controller Fault Handler. If the Controller Fault Handler does not clear the fault, then the controller shuts down. When you check the ‘Major Fault On Controller…Run Mode’ box, the controller: •must be connected to the module during the Program transition to Run mode. During the Program to Run mode transition, there can be a 20-second delay. During this delay, the controller makes one attempt to connect to a module. If the ‘Major Fault On Controller…Run Mode’ box is selected, and you cannot connect during the 20-second delay, a fault occurs because at least one required connection is not established before going

entries to the removable media when its internal buffer becomes 80% full. Additionally, the controller can be commanded to write the buffered entries to the removable media with a message instruction. This procedure is detailed below. Once a log entry is written to the removable media, it is removed from the buffer. If the removable media is not present, is full, or if the controller is not configured to automatically write buffered entries to the removable media, and the internal buffer becomes full, entries will continue to be saved in the buffer in a circular fashion. As new entries are stored, the oldest entries will be discarded. Controller Log Files and the Removable Media When written to the removable media, controller logs are stored in plain text files in the T ab Separated Value (TSV) format. Each time the controller writes entries to the CompactFlash card, the entries are appended to the text file until the file reaches 1 MB in size. At this point, the controller creates a new text file. The controller will not attempt to write log entries to a full removable media card. In the event that the removable media becomes full, the system will behave as if the removable media is not present. As controller log files are stored in plain text files in the TSV format, no special tools are required to read them. They can be opened in any text editor, or in a spreadsheet application, such as Microsoft Excel.Rockwell Automation Publication 1756-PM015E-EN-P - November 2012

Status of S:FS When the Project Has an SFCThe state of S:FS depends on the status of the SFC. •If you use S:FS in an action of a sequential function chart (SFC), S:FS is set (on) for one scan each time the step goes active. S:FS = step_name .FS. •If the SFC calls a routine, S:FS is set (on) for one scan each time the step that calls the routine goes active. S:FS = step_name .FS.To determine if Use The value you are storing cannot fit into

Additionally, the controller can be commanded to write the buffered entries to the removable media with a message instruction. This procedure is detailed below. Once a log entry is written to the removable media, it is removed from the buffer. If the removable media is not present, is full, or if the controller is not configured to automatically write buffered entries to the removable media, and the internal buffer becomes full, entries will continue to be saved in the buffer in a circular fashion.

use a connection) Requested packet interval (RPI)The RPI specifies the period at which data updates over a connection. For example, an input module sends data to a controller at the RPI that you assign to the module. •Typically, you configure an RPI in milliseconds (ms). The range is 0.2 ms (200 microseconds)…750 ms. •If a ControlNet network connects the devices, the RPI reserves a slot in the stream of data flowing across the ControlNet network. The timing of this slot may not coinci de with the exact value of the RPI, but the control system guarantees that the data transfers at least as often as the RPI. Path The path describes the route that a conn ection takes to get to the destination. Typically, you automatically define the path for a connection when you add the devices to the I/O Configuration folder of the controller.10 Rockwell Automation Publication 1756-PM015E-EN-P - November 2012Chapter 1 Connections Inhibit a ConnectionIn some situations, such as when initially commissioning a system, it is useful to disable portions of a control system and enable them as you wire the control system.

Sending a value of 0 will turn off automatic writes, and sending a value of 1 will turn on automatic writes. By default, entries are not automatically written.

entries to the removable media when its internal buffer becomes 80% full. Additionally, the controller can be commanded to write the buffered entries to the removable media with a message instruction. This procedure is detailed below. Once a log entry is written to the removable media, it is removed from the buffer. If the removable media is not present, is full, or if the controller is not configured to automatically write buffered entries to the removable media, and the internal buffer becomes full, entries will continue to be saved in the buffer in a circular fashion. As new entries are stored, the oldest entries will be discarded. Controller Log Files and the Removable Media When written to the removable media, controller logs are stored in plain text files in the T ab Separated Value (TSV) format. Each time the controller writes entries to the CompactFlash card, the entries are appended to the text file until the file reaches 1 MB in size. At this point, the controller creates a new text file. The controller will not attempt to write log entries to a full removable media card. In the event that the removable media becomes full, the system will behave as if the removable media is not present. As controller log files are stored in plain text files in the TSV format, no special tools are required to read them. They can be opened in any text editor, or in a spreadsheet application, such as Microsoft Excel.Rockwell Automation Publication 1756-PM015E-EN-P - November 2012

Automatic Save When the controller's internal log entry buffer becomes 80% full, it can automatically write the buffered entries to the CompactFlash card. Additionally, buffered entries can be automatically written before a firmware update. This is configured by sending a message instruction to the controller, using a message type of “CIP Generic” and a service type of “Controller Log Automatic W rite Set” . Sending a value of 0 will turn off automatic writes, and sending a value of 1 will turn on automatic writes. By default, entries are not automatically written.

example, if a user deletes files 001…100 but leaves the rest, the controller will start creating logs again starting at a sequence number of 001. If there are already 1000 log files and a user deletes log entries out of file 005, the controller will write the next log entries to that file. The controller starts at 000 and looks for the first file that does not exist or is less than 1 MB in size. Each time the controller opens a log file for writing, it creates a back-up file that is a copy of the log file before the write. This file is called Backup.txt. The backup is overwritten every time a log file is opened for writing. Users are responsible for periodically clearing space on the card for new log files. The controller does not delete any files off of the card to create more space for new log files.36 Rockwell Automation Publication 1756-PM015E-EN-P - November 2012Chapter 3 Controller Logging Log File Format The following table lists the information that is contained in the controller log file. The log file is formatted in UTF-16, and has a file extension of .txt. Double- clicking the file will open it in Notepad on most systems. However, since it is formatted as T ab Separated Values (TSV), it can also be opened in a spreadsheet application, like Microsoft Excel. The following screen is an example of the log file viewed in Notepad. Figure 13 - Controller Log File Viewed in Notepad The following screen is an example of the log file viewed in Excel.

Figure 12 - Log File Location The file will be called ControllerLog_yyy.txt where yyy is a sequential number from 000…999. The log file will be appended to until it reaches a size greater than 1 MB. At that point, the next write of the controller log causes a new file to be created with the next sequence number. Once there are 1000 files larger than 1 MB no more logs will be created. The controller will, however, search for the file name with the smallest possible sequence number that it can create or write to. For example, if a user deletes files 001…100 but leaves the rest, the controller will start creating logs again starting at a sequence number of 001. If there are already 1000 log files and a user deletes log entries out of file 005, the controller will write the next log entries to that file. The controller starts at 000 and looks for the first file that does not exist or is less than 1 MB in size. Each time the controller opens a log file for writing, it creates a back-up file that is a copy of the log file before the write. This file is called Backup.txt. The backup is overwritten every time

For example, even when a status flag is set, an instruction that references that flag is not highlighted. •Y ou cannot define a tag alias to a keyword. Y ou can use these key words. Status of S:FS When the Project Has an SFCThe state of S:FS depends on the status of the SFC. •If you use S:FS in an action of a sequential function chart (SFC), S:FS is set (on) for one scan each time the step goes active. S:FS = step_name .FS. •If the SFC calls a routine, S:FS is set (on) for one scan each time the step that calls the routine goes active. S:FS = step_name .FS.To determine if Use The value you are storing cannot fit into

File 38 Controller Log Events 3924 Rockwell Automation Publication 1756-PM015E-EN-P - November 2012Chapter 3 Controller Logging Controller LogA controller log is a record of interactions that have occurred in the controller due to physical conditions like keyswitch and removable media, fault conditions, and programming changes configured in the application. Up to 100 log entries are buffered within the controller's memory. The controller can save these buffered entries to the removable media by using a message instruction. Additionally, the controller can be configured to automatically write buffered entries to the removable media after 80 entries have accumulated. In the example below, Record Numbers 4-6 are part of the Change Detection feature.
