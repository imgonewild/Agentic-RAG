processes. Electrostatic charge may build up during handling. Grounding of equipment is recommended. Handling : If the product is cut or sanded, avoid exposure to dust and debris. Provide appropriate local ventilation at machinery and at places where dust can be generated. In addition, wear suitable respiratory equipment to avoid breathing dusts containing titanium dioxide and/or carbon black. Storage : Store in a dry place and away from direct sunlight. Keep away from heat, flame and strong oxidizing agents. 8. Exposure Controls and Personal Protection Occupational Exposure Limits: Not applicable. Engineering Controls : Ventilation Requirements – General ventilation should be sufficient. However, if operating conditions create high airborne concentrations of this material, special ventilation may be needed. If handling results in dust generation, special ventilation may be needed to ensure that dust exposure does not exceed the OHSA PEL for nuisance dust. Personal Protective Equipment Respiratory Protection: Not required under normal handling and processing. Should conditions exist that require respiratory protection, for example while cutting or sanding generating dusts, a NIOSH/MSHA approved respirator should be worn . Eye Protection: When cutting or processing the product, wear safety glasses with side shields. Body Protection: Wear protective gloves to avoid incidental cuts or scraps that could occur when handling the edges of product. 9. Physical and Chemical

Pictogram : There is no pictogram for a combustible dust hazard. Rough edges of InteP lus® Films could result in minor cuts to hands. Appropriate gloves should be worn to prevent cuts and/or scraps . Avoid contact with strong oxidizing agents. When working with the InteP lus® Films at hot temperatures , the material may begin to decompose producing fumes that can contain carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and other unidentified organic compounds that come from the breakdown of the materials used to make the films. Adequate ventilation should be provided to minimize exposures to vapors and fumes . When cutting, shaping or modifying InteP lus® Films , other hazards may exist. Potential Health Effects Eyes: Dust from cutting may result and mechanically irritate the eyes; if using elevated temperatures, vapors may irritate eyes. Skin: Cuts or scraps referenced above; if using elevated temperatures to soften the InteP lus® Films ,IntePlus ® Films Safety Data Sheet Sheet Last Revision: June 16, 2017 SDS, InteP lus® PE Films , Inteplast Group
processes. Electrostatic charge may build up during handling. Grounding of equipment is recommended. Handling : If the product is cut or sanded, avoid exposure to dust and debris. Provide appropriate local ventilation at machinery and at places where dust can be generated. In addition, wear suitable respiratory equipment to avoid breathing dusts containing titanium dioxide and/or carbon black. Storage : Store in a dry place and away from direct sunlight. Keep away from heat, flame and strong oxidizing agents. 8. Exposure Controls and Personal Protection Occupational Exposure Limits: Not applicable. Engineering Controls : Ventilation Requirements – General ventilation should be sufficient. However, if operating conditions create high airborne concentrations of this material, special ventilation may be needed. If handling results in dust generation, special ventilation may be needed to ensure that dust exposure does not exceed the OHSA PEL for nuisance dust. Personal Protective Equipment Respiratory Protection: Not required under normal handling and processing. Should conditions exist that require respiratory protection, for example while cutting or sanding generating dusts, a NIOSH/MSHA approved respirator should be worn . Eye Protection: When cutting or processing the product, wear safety glasses with side shields. Body Protection: Wear protective gloves to avoid incidental cuts or scraps that could occur when handling the edges of product. 9. Physical and Chemical
