In case of skin contact with hot InteP lus®, immediately immerse in or flush with clean, cold water. Ingestion: Consult physician . Inhalation: Move to fresh air. If irritation persists or breathing is difficult, get medical attention. 5. Fire Fighting Measures Extinguishing Media: Foam, dry chemical, and carbon dioxide (CO 2). Hazardous Combustion Products: Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and other possible toxic combustion products. Explosion Hazard: Avoid generating dust; fine dust dispersed in air in sufficient concentrations, and in the presence of an ignition source is a potential dust explosion hazard. Special protective equipment for firefighters: Use self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective gear. Sensitive to Static Discharge : Static discharge could be an ignition source for a combustible concentration of dust.IntePlus ® Films Safety
processes. Electrostatic charge may build up during handling. Grounding of equipment is recommended. Handling : If the product is cut or sanded, avoid exposure to dust and debris. Provide appropriate local ventilation at machinery and at places where dust can be generated. In addition, wear suitable respiratory equipment to avoid breathing dusts containing titanium dioxide and/or carbon black. Storage : Store in a dry place and away from direct sunlight. Keep away from heat, flame and strong oxidizing agents. 8. Exposure Controls and Personal Protection Occupational Exposure Limits: Not applicable. Engineering Controls : Ventilation Requirements – General ventilation should be sufficient. However, if operating conditions create high airborne concentrations of this material, special ventilation may be needed. If handling results in dust generation, special ventilation may be needed to ensure that dust exposure does not exceed the OHSA PEL for nuisance dust. Personal Protective Equipment Respiratory Protection: Not required under normal handling and processing. Should conditions exist that require respiratory protection, for example while cutting or sanding generating dusts, a NIOSH/MSHA approved respirator should be worn .
