before reuse. Clean shoes thoroughly before reuse.Remove victim to fresh air and keep at rest in a position comfortable for breathing. If it 
is suspected that gas or vapor is still present, the rescuer should wear an appropriate 
mask or self-contained breathing apparatus. If not breathing, if breathing is irregular or 
if respiratory arrest occurs, provide artificial respiration or oxygen by trained personnel.
It may be dangerous to the person providing aid to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
