Methods include mechanical ventilation (dilution and local exhaust), process or personnel enclosure, control of proce ss conditions and process modification (e.g. substitution of a less hazardous material). Because of the high potential hazard associated with this substance, stringent control measures such as enclosure or isolation should be considered for large scale operations. A totally enclosed syst em with an associated purging system should be considered for unl oading bulk hydrogen peroxide and sampling process liquids. To prevent the release of hydrogen peroxide due to equipment failure, backup co ntrols (e.g. double mechanical seals for process pumps) should be considered. Supply s ufficient replacement air to make up for air removed by exhau st systems. Do not use organic or combustible materials such as wood in the construction of ventilation or control systems.

for all exposures except minor instances of inhalation or skin contact. All first aid procedures should be periodically reviewed by a doctor famili ar with the material and its condition of u se in the workplace. Attempts at evacuating the stomach via emesis induction or gastric lavage should be avoided. In the event of severe distension of the stomach or esophagus due to gastric formation, insertion of a gastric tube may be required. SECTION 5 – Fire Fighting Measures General Information: Hydrogen peroxide solutions, 20% to less than 35%, do not bur n, but are moderate to strong oxidizing agents. Concentrations of 27.5% and above can cause combustible materials such as w ood, paper, oils and grease to burst into flames and will support, accelerate and intensify the burning of combustible materials in a fire. Some subst ances that do not normally burn in air will ignite or explo de upon contact with hydrogen peroxide. Closed containers may rupture violently due to rapi d decomposition, if exposed to fire or excessive heat for a sufficient period of time, or if contaminated with certain metals or dirt. Large amounts of oxygen gas may be released to form an oxygen-rich atmosp here. No part of a container should be subjected to a temperature higher than 49 °C (120 °F).

Attempts at evacuating the stomach via emesis induction or gastric lavage should be avoided. In the event of severe distension of the stomach or esophagus due to gastric formation, insertion of a gastric tube may be required. SECTION 5 – Fire Fighting Measures General Information: Hydrogen peroxide solutions, 20% to less than 35%, do not bur n, but are moderate to strong oxidizing agents. Concentrations of 27.5% and above can cause combustible materials such as w ood, paper, oils and grease to burst into flames and will support, accelerate and intensify the burning of combustible materials in a fire. Some subst ances that do not normally burn in air will ignite or explo de upon contact with hydrogen peroxide. Closed containers may rupture violently due to rapi d decomposition, if exposed to fire or excessive heat for a sufficient period of time, or if contaminated with certain metals or dirt. Large amounts of oxygen gas may be released to form an oxygen-rich atmosp here. No part of a container should be subjected to a temperature higher than 49 °C (120 °F). Firefighter's normal protective equipment (Bunker Ge ar) will not provide adequate protection.

Conditions to Avoid: Heat, open flames, contamination, depletion of stabilizers, pH > 4.5. Incompatibilities with Other Materials: Hydrogen peroxide solutions (30% or greater) are st rong oxidizing agents capabl e of reacting explosively with many substances. Some organi c compounds form unstable peroxides. COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS (e.g. wood, paper, textiles, oil, grease) - may cause fire or explosion upon contact. STRONG BASES (e.g potassium hydroxide or s odium hydroxide) - can explode violently. NITRIC ACID (more than 50%) or SULFURIC ACID - mixtures with 35% and above hydrogen peroxide can explode violently. ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (e.g. carboxylic acid s and anhydrides, nitrogen-containing bases, al dehydes, ketones, ethers, alcohols, charc oal, organic dust) – spontaneous combustion, violent dec omposition and/or explosion may occur. METALS (powdered or metal surfaces), METAL OXIDES, METAL SULF IDES METAL SALTS, or IODATES - may cause violent decomposition. REDUCING AGENTS (e.g. metal hydrides) - may react violently. POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE - can explode when in contact with very concentrated hydrogen peroxide.

Keep absorbents for leaks readily available. SECTION 8 – Exposure Control/Personal Protection Engineering Controls: Engineering methods to control hazardous conditions are prefer red. Methods include mechanical ventilation (dilution and local exhaust), process or personnel enclosure, control of proce ss conditions and process modification (e.g. substitution of a less hazardous material). Because of the high potential hazard associated with this substance, stringent control measures such as enclosure or isolation should be considered for large scale operations. A totally enclosed syst em with an associated purging system should be considered for unl oading bulk hydrogen peroxide and sampling process liquids. To prevent the release of hydrogen peroxide due to equipment failure, backup co ntrols (e.g. double mechanical seals for process pumps) should be considered. Supply s ufficient replacement air to make up for air removed by exhau st systems. Do not use organic or combustible materials such as wood in the construction of ventilation or control systems.
