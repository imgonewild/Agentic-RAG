In very severe cases, bronchi tis or a potentially life-threat ening accumulation of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) may occur. However, no reports of these effects in humans were located. Eyes: Hydrogen peroxide solutions of 20% to less than 35% are corrosive to eyes based on animal information. Corrosive materials are capable of producing severe eye burns, and permanent injury, including bl indness, depending on the concentration of the solutions and dura tion of contact. No human information was located for hydrogen peroxide solutions of 20% to less than 35%. Direct contact with dilute solutions (up to 3%) has not resulted in permanent eye injury. Skin: Hydrogen peroxide solutions of 20% to less than 35% are very mild skin irritants based on animal information. Prolonged contact (e.g. 24- hours) can cause moderate to severe irritation. Whitening or bl eaching of the skin has been observed in humans following contac t with dilute solutions. Exposure to 35% hydrogen peroxide may result in r edness and an eruption of gas bubbles under the skin described as b eing similar to bubble wrap; however, the skin eruptions heal r apidly without scarring following treatment.

SECTION 5 – Fire Fighting Measures General Information: Hydrogen peroxide solutions, 20% to less than 35%, do not bur n, but are moderate to strong oxidizing agents. Concentrations of 27.5% and above can cause combustible materials such as w ood, paper, oils and grease to burst into flames and will support, accelerate and intensify the burning of combustible materials in a fire. Some subst ances that do not normally burn in air will ignite or explo de upon contact with hydrogen peroxide. Closed containers may rupture violently due to rapi d decomposition, if exposed to fire or excessive heat for a sufficient period of time, or if contaminated with certain metals or dirt. Large amounts of oxygen gas may be released to form an oxygen-rich atmosp here. No part of a container should be subjected to a temperature higher than 49 °C (120 °F). Firefighter's normal protective equipment (Bunker Ge ar) will not provide adequate protection.
