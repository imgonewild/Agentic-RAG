 'entries to the removable media when its internal buffer becomes 80% full. Additionally, the controller can be commanded to write the buffered entries to the removable media with a message instruction. This procedure is detailed below. Once a log entry is written to the removable media, it is removed from the buffer. If the removable media is not present, is full, or if the controller is not configured to automatically write buffered entries to the removable media, and the internal buffer becomes full, entries will continue to be saved in the buffer in a circular fashion. As new entries are stored, the oldest entries will be discarded. Controller Log Files and the Removable Media When written to the removable media, controller logs are stored in plain text files in the T ab Separated Value (TSV) format. Each time the controller writes entries to the CompactFlash card, the entries are appended to the text file until the file reaches 1 MB in size. At this point, the controller creates a new text file. The controller will not attempt to write log entries to a full removable media card. In the event that the removable media becomes full, the system will behave as if the removable media is not present. As controller log files are stored in plain text files in the TSV format, no special tools are required to read them.

 'entries to the removable media when its internal buffer becomes 80% full. Additionally, the controller can be commanded to write the buffered entries to the removable media with a message instruction. This procedure is detailed below. Once a log entry is written to the removable media, it is removed from the buffer. If the removable media is not present, is full, or if the controller is not configured to automatically write buffered entries to the removable media, and the internal buffer becomes full, entries will continue to be saved in the buffer in a circular fashion. As new entries are stored, the oldest entries will be discarded. Controller Log Files and the Removable Media When written to the removable media, controller logs are stored in plain text files in the T ab Separated Value (TSV) format. Each time the controller writes entries to the CompactFlash card, the entries are appended to the text file until the file reaches 1 MB in size. At this point, the controller creates a new text file. The controller will not attempt to write log entries to a full removable media card. In the event that the removable media becomes full, the system will behave as if the removable media is not present. As controller log files are stored in plain text files in the TSV format, no special tools are required to read them.

Automatic Save When the controller's internal log entry buffer becomes 80% full, it can automatically write the buffered entries to the CompactFlash card. Additionally, buffered entries can be automatically written before a firmware update. This is configured by sending a message instruction to the controller, using a message type of “CIP Generic” and a service type of “Controller Log Automatic W rite Set” . Sending a value of 0 will turn off automatic writes, and sending a value of 1 will turn on automatic writes. By default, entries are not automatically written. A rung of logic that performs this configuration and the configuration dialog box of the message instruction are shown below. Figure 2 - Automatic Save""
