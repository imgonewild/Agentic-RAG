Term Definition Connection A communication link between two devices, such as between a controller and an I/O module, PanelView terminal, or another controller. Connections are allocations of resources that provide more reliable communication between devices than unconnected messages. The number of connections that a single controller can have
breaks the connection to the module and prevents communication of I/O data. Inhibit communication with the module If you want to Then Communicate with the module Do not inhibit the module Prevent communication with the module Inhibit the module ! If you are And you And Then Offline The inhibit status is stored in the project. When you download the project, the module still is inhibited. Online Inhibit a module while you are connected to the moduleThe connection to the module is closed. The modu lesâ€™ outputs go to the last configured Program mode. Inhibit a module but a connection to the module was not established (perhaps due to an error condition or fault)The module is inhibited. The module status information changes to indicate that the module is inhibited and not faulted. Uninhibit a module (clear the check box) No fault occurs A connection is ma de to the module and the module is dynamically reconfi gured (if the controller is the owner-controller) with the co nfiguration you created for that module. If the controller is configured for listen-only, it cannot reconfigure the module. Fault occurs A connection is not made to the module. The module status information changes to indicate the fault condition.Rockwell Automation Publication 1756-PM015E-EN-P - November 2012 11Connections Chapter 1 Follow these steps to inhibit or uninhibit a module from logic. 1.Use a Get System V alue (GSV) instruction to read the Mode attribute for the module. 2.Set or clear bit 2. 3.Use a Set
