Vibration and Shock The drive settings allow the user to choose between high carrier PWM control and low carrier PWM. Selecting high carrier PWM can help reduce motor oscillation. Take particular caution when using a variable speed drive for an application that is conventionally run from line power at a constant speed. If mechanical resonance occurs, install shock-absorbing rubber around the base of the motor and enable the Jump frequency selection parameter to prevent continuous operation in the resonant frequency range. Audible Noise Noise created during run varies by the carrier frequency setting.

Braking torque drops to less than half when running at less than 20% speed. • Load Inertia: In Open Loop Vector Control for PM motors, the allowable load inertia moment is approximately 50 times higher than the motor inertia moment or less.

Failure to set the proper timing can result in speed loss. Not for use with conveyor, transport, or hoist type applications. • Restarting a Coasting Motor: To restart a coasting motor rotating at over 200 Hz while in the V/f control mode, use the Short Circuit Braking function to first bring the motor to a stop. Short Circuit Braking requires a special braking resistor. Contact Yaskawa or your Yaskawa agent for details. Speed Search can be used to restart a coasting motor rotating slower than 200 Hz. If the motor cable is relatively long, however, the motor should instead be stopped using Short Circuit Braking, which forces the motor to stop by creating a short-circuit in the motor windings. nApplications with Specialized Motors Multi-Pole Motor Because the rated current will differ from a standard motor, be sure to check the maximum current when selecting a drive. Always stop the motor before switching between the number of motor poles. If a regen overvoltage (oV) fault occurs or if overcurrent protection (oC) is triggered, the motor will coast to stop. Submersible Motor Because motor rated current is greater than a standard motor, select the drive capacity accordingly. Be sure to use a large enough gauge motor cable to avoid decreasing the maximum torque

The drive is not designed for explosion proof areas. Furthermore, if an encoder is attached to an explosion-proof motor make sure the encoder is also explosion-proof. Use an insulating signal converter for connecting the encoder signal lines to the drives speed feedback option card. Geared Motor To avoid gear damage when operating at low speeds or very high speeds, make sure that both the gear and lubricant are rated for the desired speed range. Consult with the manufacturer for applications that require operation outside the rated speed range of the motor or gear box. Single-Phase Motor Variable speed AC drives

Geared Motor To avoid gear damage when operating at low speeds or very high speeds, make sure that both the gear and lubricant are rated for the desired speed range. Consult with the manufacturer for applications that require operation outside the rated speed range of the motor or gear box. Single-Phase Motor Variable speed AC drives are not designed for operation with single phase motors. Using capacitors to start the motor causes excessive current to flow and can damage drive components. A split-phase start or a repulsion start can end up burning out the starter coils because the internal centrifugal switch is not activated. The drive is for use with 3-phase motors only. Motor with Brake Caution should be taken when using a drive to operate a motor with a built-in holding brake. If the brake is connected to the output side of the drive, it may not release at start due to low voltage levels. A separate power supply should be installed for the motor brake. Motors with a built-in brake tend to generate a fair amount of noise when running at low speeds. nPower Driven Machinery (decelerators, belts, chains, etc.) Continuous operation at low speeds wears on the lubricating material used in gear box type systems to accelerate

Failure to comply could result in overheating and fire. When multiple drives are placed inside the same enclosure panel, install proper cooling to ensure air entering the enclosure does not exceed 40 °C. CAUTION Crush Hazard Do not carry the drive by the front cover. Failure to comply may result in minor or moderate injury from the main body of the drive falling. NOTICE Observe proper electrostatic discharge (ESD) procedures when handling the drive. Failure to comply could result in ESD damage to the drive circuitry. It may be difficult to perform maintenance on the cooling fans of drives installed in a vertical row inside an enclosure. Ensure adequate spacing at the top of the drive to perform cooling fan replacement when required.

Content: procedures when handling the drive. Failure to comply could result in ESD damage to the drive circuitry. It may be difficult to perform maintenance on the cooling fans of drives installed in a vertical row inside an enclosure. Ensure adequate spacing at the top of the drive to perform cooling fan replacement when required. Operating the motor in the low-speed range diminishes the cooling effects, increases motor temperature, and may lead to motor damage by overheating. Reduce the motor torque in the low-speed range whenever using a standard blower cooled motor. If 100% torque is required continuously at low speed, consider using a special drive or vector motor. Select a motor that is compatible with the required load torque and operating speed range. Do not operate motors above the maximum rated RPM. Failure to comply may lead to bearing or other mechanical motor failures. The speed range for continuous operation differs according to the lubrication method and motor manufacturer. If the motor is to be operated at a speed higher than the rated speed, consult with the manufacturer. Continuously operating an oil-lubricated motor in the low-speed range may result in burning.2.1 Section Safety 36 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical ManualNOTICE When the wiring distance is greater than 100 meters, pay special attention to the motor insulation voltage or use a drive-rated motor.

Continuously operating an oil-lubricated motor in the low-speed range may result in burning.2.1 Section Safety 36 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical ManualNOTICE When the wiring distance is greater than 100 meters, pay special attention to the motor insulation voltage or use a drive-rated motor. Failure to comply could lead to motor winding failure. Motor vibration may increase when operating a machine in variable-speed mode, if that machine previously operated at a constant speed. Install vibration-proof rubber on the motor base or use the frequency jump function to skip a frequency resonating the machine. The motor may require more acceleration torque with drive operation than with a commercial power supply. Set a proper V/f pattern by checking the load torque characteristics of the machine to be used with the motor. The rated input current of submersible motors is higher than the rated input current of standard motors. Select an appropriate drive according to its rated output current. When the distance between the motor and drive is long, use a cable thick enough to connect the motor to the drive to prevent motor torque reduction. When using an explosion-proof motor, it must be subject to an explosion-proof test in conjunction with the drive. This

When the distance between the motor and drive is long, use a cable thick enough to connect the motor to the drive to prevent motor torque reduction. When using an explosion-proof motor, it must be subject to an explosion-proof test in conjunction with the drive. This is also applicable when an existing explosion-proof motor is to be operated with the drive. Since the drive itself is not explosion-proof, always install it in a safe place. Be sure to set A1-02 to “0” when using an explosion-proof motor. Do not use a drive for a single-phase motor. Replace the motor with a three-phase motor. If an oil-lubricated gearbox or speed reducer is used in the power transmission mechanism, oil lubrication will be affected when the motor operates only in the low speed range. The power transmission mechanism will make noise and experience problems with service life and durability if the motor is operated at a speed higher than the rated speed.2.1 Section Safety YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual 372Mechanical Installation2.2 Mechanical Installation This section outlines specifications, procedures, and environment for proper

NOTICE: Do not connect the AC power line to the output motor terminals of the drive. Failure to comply could result in death or serious injury by fire as a result of drive damage from line voltage application to output terminals. nCable Length Between Drive and Motor When the cable length between the drive and the motor is too long (especially at low frequency output), note that the cable voltage drop may cause reduced motor torque. Drive output current will increase as the leakage current from the cable increases. An increase in leakage current may trigger an overcurrent situation and weaken the accuracy of the current detection. Adjust the drive carrier frequency according to the following table. If the motor wiring distance exceeds 100 m because of the system configuration, reduce the ground currents. Refer to C6-02: Carrier Frequency Selection on page 156 Refer to Table 3.5 to set the carrier frequency to an appropriate level. Table 3.5 Cable Length Between Drive and Motor Cable Length 50 m or less 100 m or less Greater than 100 m Carrier Frequency 15 kHz or less 5 kHz or less 2 kHz or less Note: When setting carrier frequency, calculate the cable length as the total distance of wiring to all connected motors when running multiple motors from a single drive.3.6 Main Circuit Wiring YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606

This is fundamentally different from other types of Auto-Tuning features used in servo systems. • Auto-Tuning requires the user to input data from the motor nameplate. Make sure the information written on the nameplate is available before Auto-Tuning the drive. • For best performance, be sure the drive input supply voltage equals or exceeds the motor rated voltage. Note: Performance can be enhanced by using a motor with a base voltage that is 20 V (40 V for 400 V class models) lower than the input supply voltage. This may be of special importance when operating the motor above 90% of base speed, where high torque precision is required. • Auto-Tuning is not possible with permanent magnet motors. • To cancel Auto-Tuning, press the STOP key on the LED operator. •Table 4.21 describes digital input and output terminal status during Auto-Tuning.

Disconnect or decouple the motor from the load. nNotes on Rotational Auto-Tuning • For optimal performance, Auto-Tuning should only be done with the motor uncoupled from the load for applications requiring high performance over a wide speed range. • If motor and load cannot be uncoupled, the load should be lower than 30% of the rated load. Performing Rotational Auto- Tuning with a higher load will set motor parameters incorrectly, and can cause irregular motor rotation. • Ensure the motor-mounted brake is fully released if installed.4.7 Auto-Tuning 102 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual• Connected machinery should be allowed to rotate the motor. nNotes on Stationary Auto-Tuning for Terminal Resistance Only •If the motor cable lead length has been significantly modified after Auto-Tuning has already been performed, perform Stationary Auto-Tuning with the new cables. • Perform when using motor cables longer than 50 m with

Back EMF Voltage Estimation This method is used by Speed Search after short Baseblock (e.g. a power loss where the drives CPU kept running and the Run command was kept active). Here the drive estimates the motor speed by analyzing the back EMF voltage. It outputs the estimated frequency and increases the voltage using the time constant set in parameter L2-04.

Current Detection should be used in such situations. • Use Current Detection instead of Speed Estimation when operating motors smaller than 1.5 kW. Speed Estimation can end up stopping smaller motors as it might not be able to detect the speed or rotation direction of such small motors. • Use Short circuit Braking instead of Speed Estimation when using Open Loop Vector Control for PM motors along with a fairly long motor cable. • Use Short circuit Braking instead of Speed Estimation if attempting to find the speed of a motor coasting faster than 120 Hz in Open Loop Vector Control for PM motors. nCurrent Detection Type Speed Search

Be aware that sudden acceleration may occur when using Current Detection with relatively light loads. This method detects the motor speed by reducing the output frequency and measuring the current. The frequency reduction starts from the maximum output frequency or from the set frequency reference. As long as the output frequency is higher than the rotor speed, the slip will cause a high current. The closer the output frequency comes to the rotor speed, the lower the current draw will be. When the output current drops below the level as set in b3-02, the output frequency stops decreasing and normal operation resumes.

With P control only an offset between the target and feedback remains. nI Control The output of I control is the integral of the deviation. It minimizes the offset between target and feedback value that typically remains when pure P control is used. The integral time (I-time) constant determines how fast the offset is eliminated. nD Control D control predicts the deviation signal by multiplying its derivative (slope of the deviation) with a time constant and adding this to the PID input. This way the D portion of a PID controller provides a braking action to the controller response and can reduce the tendency of oscillations and overshoot. Be aware that D control tends to amplify noise on the deviation signal, which can result in control instability. D control should therefore only be used when necessary. nPID Operation To better demonstrate how PID works, the diagram below shows how the PID output changes when the PID input (deviation) jumps from 0 to a constant level.

The pulse input provides one track only and cannot detect the direction of motor rotation. A separate motor speed direction signal must therefore be input to the ASR by: 1. Using a Digital Input This method is automatically enabled when a digital input is programmed for “Forward/Reverse direction” (H1- oo = 7E). If the input is closed, the drive assumes reverse rotation. If open, then the drive assumes that the motor is rotating forwards. When a 2 track encoder is used, an external unit that converts the 2 tracks into 1 track and a digital direction signal can be used. 2. Using the Frequency Reference Direction When no digital input is set for “Forward/Reverse direction” (H1- oo≠ 7E), ASR uses the direction of the frequency reference.

Setting F: Not Used/Through Mode Any digital input that is not used should be set to F. When set to “F”, an input does not trigger any function in the drive. Setting F, however, still allows the input status to be read out by a PLC via a communication option or MEMOBUS/Modbus communications (through mode). This way external sensors can be connected to unused drive digital inputs, thus reducing the need for separate PLC I/O units. Setting 10/11: Up/Down Command Using the Up/Down function allows the frequency reference to be set by two push buttons. One digital input must be programmed as the Up input (H1- oo= 10) to increase the frequency reference, the other one must be programmed as the Down input (H1-oo= 11) to decrease the frequency reference.

The value that was saved can be reset by closing either the Up or Down input without having a Run command active. Refer to d4-01: Frequency Reference Hold Function Selection on page 162. Using the Up/Down Function with Frequency Reference Limits The upper frequency reference limit is determined by parameter d2-01. The value for the lower frequency reference limit depends on the setting of parameter d4-10 and can be set by an analog input or parameter d2-02.

Drive Input Voltage Stall Prevention Level during Deceleration 200 V Class Vdc = 380 V 400 V ClassE1-01 ≥ 400 V Vdc = 760 V E1-01 < 400 V Vdc = 660 V Note: 1. This setting should not be used in combination with a Dynamic Braking Resistor or other braking options.

This way the shortest possible deceleration time is achieved while the motor is protected from stalling. The deceleration time that has been selected is disregarded, but the achievable deceleration time cannot be smaller than 1/10 of the set deceleration time. This function uses the following parameters for adjusting the deceleration rate: • DC bus voltage gain L3-20 • Deceleration rate calculations gain L3-21 • Inertia calculations for motor acceleration time L3-24 • Load inertia ratio L3-25 Refer to these parameter descriptions for details. Note: As the deceleration time is not constant, Intelligent Stall Prevention should not be used in applications where stopping accuracy is a concern.

HSB stops the motor by reducing the output frequency in large steps, thus producing a high slip. Regenerative energy created from decelerating the load is dissipated in the motor windings through increased motor slip. Because of the increased temperature of the motor windings, HSB should not be used for frequently stopping the motor. The duty cycle should be around 5% or less.

Because of the increased temperature of the motor windings, HSB should not be used for frequently stopping the motor. The duty cycle should be around 5% or less. Notes on using High Slip Braking: • The deceleration time that has been set is ignored during HSB. • Braking time varies based on the load inertia and motor characteristics. •HSB must be triggered by a digital input set to H1- oo = 68. Once the HSB command is given, it is not possible to restart the drive until the motor is stopped and the Run command is cycled. Use parameters n3-01 through n3-04 for adjusting HSB. Overexcitation Deceleration (V/f Control and Open Loop Vector) Overexcitation deceleration increases the flux during deceleration and allows shorter deceleration time settings than with normal deceleration without the use of a braking resistor. Enabled by setting L3-04 = 4. Notes on Overexcitation Deceleration • As regenerative energy is mainly dissipated as heat in the motor, the motor temperature will rise if overexcitation deceleration is applied frequently.

Notes on Overexcitation Deceleration • As regenerative energy is mainly dissipated as heat in the motor, the motor temperature will rise if overexcitation deceleration is applied frequently. In such cases, make sure the motor temperature does not exceed the maximum allowable value or consider using a braking resistor option instead. • The drive decelerates at the active deceleration time.

NOTICE: Use a class 2 power supply (UL standard) when connecting to the control terminals. Improper application of peripheral devices could result in drive performance degradation due to improper power supply. uInstalling a Molded Case Circuit Breaker (MCCB) and Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB) Install an MCCB or ELCB for line protection between the power supply and the main circuit power supply input terminals R/ L1, S/L2 and T/L3. This protects the main circuit and devices wired to the main circuit while also providing overload protection. Consider the following when selecting and installing an MCCB or ELCB: • The rated current of the MCCB or ELCB should be 1.5 to 2 times the rated output current of the drive. Use an MCCB or ELCB with operation characteristics that do not trip the MCCB or ELCB faster than the drive overload protection (shuts off the drive after 1 minute of operation at 150% of the drive rated current). • If several drives are connected to one MCCB or an ELCB that is shared with other equipment, use a sequence that shuts the power OFF when errors are output by using magnetic contactor (MC) as shown in the following figure.

Failure to comply may result in serious injury or death. uInstalling a Leakage Breaker Drive outputs generate high-frequency leakage current as a result of high-speed switching. Install a GFCI on the input side of the drive to switch off potentially harmful leakage current. Factors in determining leakage current: • Size of the AC drive • AC drive carrier frequency • Motor cable type and length • EMI/RFI filter If the GFCI trips spuriously, consider changing these items or use a GFCI with a higher trip level. Note: Choose a GFCI designed specifically for an AC drive. The operation time should be at least 0.1 s with sensitivity amperage of at least 200 mA per drive. The output waveform of the drive may cause an increase in leakage current. This may in turn cause the leakage breaker to malfunction. Increase the sensitivity amperage or lower the carrier frequency to correct the problem.8.4 Installing

Install a motor thermal overload relay between the drive and motor: • When operating multiple motors on a single AC drive. • When using a power line bypass to operate the motor directly from the power line. It is not necessary to install a motor thermal overload relay when operating a single motor from a single AC drive. The AC drive has UL recognized electronic motor overload protection built into the drive software. Note: Disable the motor protection function (L1-0 1 = “0”) when using an external motor thermal overload relay. The relay should shut off main power on the input side of the main circuit when triggered. nGeneral Precautions when Using Thermal Overload Relays The following application precautions should be considered when using motor thermal overload relays on

Note: Disable the motor protection function (L1-0 1 = “0”) when using an external motor thermal overload relay. The relay should shut off main power on the input side of the main circuit when triggered. nGeneral Precautions when Using Thermal Overload Relays The following application precautions should be considered when using motor thermal overload relays on the output of AC drives in order to prevent nuisance trips or overheat of the motor at low speeds: • Low speed motor operation • Use of multiple motors on a single AC drive • Motor cable length • Nuisance tripping resulting from high AC drive carrier frequency Low Speed Operation and Motor Thermal oL Relays Generally, thermal relays are applied on general-purpose motors. When general-purpose motors are driven by AC drives, the motor current is approximately 5 to 10% greater than if driven by the commercial power supply. In addition, the cooling capacity of a motor with a shaft-driven fan decreases when operating at low speeds. Even if the load current is within the motor rated value, motor overheating may occur. A thermal relay cannot effectively protect the motor due to the reduction of cooling at low speeds. For this reason, apply the UL recognized electronic thermal overload protection

When general-purpose motors are driven by AC drives, the motor current is approximately 5 to 10% greater than if driven by the commercial power supply. In addition, the cooling capacity of a motor with a shaft-driven fan decreases when operating at low speeds. Even if the load current is within the motor rated value, motor overheating may occur. A thermal relay cannot effectively protect the motor due to the reduction of cooling at low speeds. For this reason, apply the UL recognized electronic thermal overload protection function built into the drive whenever possible. UL recognized electronic thermal overload function of the drive: Speed-dependent heat characteristics are simulated using data from standard motors and force-ventilated motors. The motor is protected from overload using this function. Using One Drive with Multiple Motors Turn off the electronic thermal overload function. Please refer to the appropriate product instruction manual to determine which parameter disables this function. The UL recognized electronic thermal overload function of the drive cannot be applied when using multiple motors on one drive. Long Motor Cables When long motor cables and high carrier frequency are used, nuisance tripping of the thermal relay may occur due to increased leakage current. Therefore, reduce the carrier frequency or increase the tripping level of the thermal overload relay. Nuisance Tripping

The UL recognized electronic thermal overload function of the drive cannot be applied when using multiple motors on one drive. Long Motor Cables When long motor cables and high carrier frequency are used, nuisance tripping of the thermal relay may occur due to increased leakage current. Therefore, reduce the carrier frequency or increase the tripping level of the thermal overload relay. Nuisance Tripping Resulting from High AC Drive Carrier Frequency Current waveforms generated by high carrier frequency PWM drives tend to create additional temperature rise in overload relays. Therefore, it may be necessary to increase the trip level setting when encountering nuisance triggering of the relay.8.4 Installing Peripheral Devices YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual 3358Peripheral Devices & OptionsWARNING!

In the same way, the slave drive must wait before sending response messages to prevent an overrun in the master. This section explains the message timing. uCommand Messages from Master to Drive In order to prevent overrun and data loss, the master must wait between receiving a response and sending the same type of command as before to the same slave drive. The minimum wait time depends on the command as shown in the table below.

The message format is configured for both sending and receiving as shown below, and the length of data packets depends on the command (function) content. SLAVE ADDRESS FUNCTION CODE DATA ERROR CHECK uSlave Address The slave address in the message defines the note the message is sent to. Use addresses between 0 and 20H. If a message with slave address 0 is sent (broadcast), the command from the master will be received by all slaves. The slaves do not provide a response to a broadcast type message. uFunction Code The three types of function codes are shown in the table below.

The data length changes depending on the command details. A drive MEMOBUS/Modbus register always has a data length of two bytes. Therefore data written into drive registers must also always have a length of two bytes. Register data read out from the drive will always consist of two bytes. uError Check The drive uses a CRC-16 (cyclic redundancy check, checksum method) for checking data validity. Use the procedure described below when calculating the CRC-16 checksum for command data or when verifying response data. nCommand Data When the drive receives data, it calculates the CRC-16 checksum from the data and compares it to the CRC-16 value received within the message. Both must match before a command is processed.

Both must match before a command is processed. An initial value of FFFFH (i.e., all 16 bits equal 1) must be used for CRC-16 calculations for the MEMOBUS/Modbus protocol. Calculate the CRC-16 checksum using the following steps: • The starting value is FFFFH. • Perform an XOR operation of this value and the slave address. • Right shift the result. • When the overflow bit of the shift operation becomes 1, perform an XOR operation of the result from step 3 above and the fix value A001H. • Repeat steps 3 and 4 until eight shift operations have been performed. • After eight shift operations, perform an XOR operation with the result and the next data in the message (function code, register address, data). Continue with steps 3 to 5 until the last data has been processed. • The result of the last shift or XOR operation is the checksum.C.8 Message Format 444 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical ManualThe example in

This sections explains Enter commands. uEnter Command Types The drive supports two types of Enter commands as shown in Table C.6 . An Enter command is enabled by writing 0 to register number 0900H or 0910H. These registers can be written to only. An error will occur if the user attempts to read from these registers. Table C.6 Enter Command Types Register No. Description 0900HWrites data into the EEPROM (non-volatile memory) of the drive and enables the data in RAM at the same time. Parameter changes remain even if the power supply is cycled. 0910H Writes data in the RAM only. Parameter changes are lost when the drive is shut off. Note: 1. Because the EEPROM can be written to a maximum of 100,000 times, refrain from writing to the EEPROM too often. The Enter command registers are write-only. Consequently, if these registers are read, then the register address will be invalid (Error code: 02H). An Enter command is not required if reference or broadcast data are sent to the drive. 2.Parameter

The Enter command registers are write-only. Consequently, if these registers are read, then the register address will be invalid (Error code: 02H). An Enter command is not required if reference or broadcast data are sent to the drive. 2.Parameter data cannot be written to EEPROM during undervoltage, even using 0900H. 3.If undervoltage occurs when a making several parameter changes issued with a single ENTER command, the writing process may be aborted before all of the new changes have been written. Because all of the data has not yet been written, the EEPROM data error “CPF06” will be displayed the next time power to the drive is cycled. To prevent this problem, wait approximately 5 seconds after issuing the ENTER command before shutting off drive power. uEnter Command Settings when Upgrading the Drive When replacing earlier Yaskawa drive models with a V1000 and keeping the MEMOBUS/Modbus communications settings, parameter H5-11 needs to be set in accordance with how the Enter command functions in the older drive.

Content: 2 Drive Duty Motor with a Speed Range of 1:10 3 Vector Motor with a Speed Range of 1:100 4 Permanent Magnet Motor with Variable Torque 6 Standard Fan-Cooled Motor (50 Hz) Disable the electronic overload protection (L1-01 = 0: Disabled) and wire each motor with its own motor thermal overload when connecting the drive to more than one motor for simultaneous operation. Enable the motor overload protection (L1-01 = “1”, “2”, or “3”) when connecting the drive to a single motor unless there is another means of preventing motor thermal overload. The electronic thermal overload function causes an oL1 fault, which shuts off the output of the drive and prevents additional overheating of the motor. The motor temperature is continually calculated as long as the drive is powered up. Setting L1-01 = 1 selects a motor with limited cooling capability below rated (base) speed when running at 100% load. The oL1 function derates the motor when it is running below base speed. Setting L1-01 = 2 selects a motor capable of cooling itself over a 10:1 speed range when running at 100% load. The oL1 function derates the motor when it is running at 1/10 or less of its rated speed. Setting L1-01 = 3 selects a motor capable of cooling itself at any speed — including zero speed — when running at 100% load. The oL1 function does not derate the motor at any speed. Setting L1-01 = 4 selects protection for a PM motor with variable torque. nL1-02: Motor Overload Protection Time Setting Range: 0.1 to 5.0

The oL1 function derates the motor when it is running at 1/10 or less of its rated speed. Setting L1-01 = 3 selects a motor capable of cooling itself at any speed — including zero speed — when running at 100% load. The oL1 function does not derate the motor at any speed. Setting L1-01 = 4 selects protection for a PM motor with variable torque. nL1-02: Motor Overload Protection Time Setting Range: 0.1 to 5.0 Minutes Factory Default: 1.0 Minutes The L1-02 parameter sets the allowed operation time before the oL1 fault occurs when the drive is running at 60 Hz and 150% of the full load amp rating (E2-01) of the motor. Adjusting the value of L1-02 can shift the set of oL1 curves up the Y-axis of the diagram below but will not change the shape of the curves.

Connect the Safe Disable inputs to the devices in compliance with safety requirements. Failure to comply will cause death or serious injury. WARNING! Sudden Movement Hazard. When using a PM motor, even if the drive output is shut off by the Safe Disable function, a breakdown of two output transistors can cause current to flow through the motor winding, resulting in a motor output axis movement for a maximum angle of 180 degrees (electrically). Make sure such a situation would have no effect on the safety of the application when using the Safe Disable function. Failure to comply could cause serious injury or death. WARNING! Electrical Shock Hazard. The Safe Disable function can switch off the drive output, but does not cut the drive power supply and cannot electrically isolate the drive output from the input. Always shut off the drive power supply when performing maintenance or installations on the drive input side as well as the drive output side. Failure to comply could cause serious injury or death.
