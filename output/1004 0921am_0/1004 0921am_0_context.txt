operation than with a commercial power supply. Set a proper V/f pattern by checking the load torque characteristics of the machine to be used with the motor. The rated input current of submersible motors is higher than the rated input current of standard motors. Select an appropriate drive according to its rated output current. When the distance between the motor and drive is long, use a cable thick enough to connect the motor to the drive to prevent motor torque reduction. When using an explosion-proof motor, it must be subject to an explosion-proof test in conjunction with the drive. This is also applicable when an existing explosion-proof motor is to be operated with the drive. Since the drive itself is not explosion-proof, always install it in a safe place. Be sure to set A1-02 to “0” when using an explosion-proof motor. Do not use a drive for a single-phase motor. Replace the motor with a three-phase motor. If an oil-lubricated gearbox or speed reducer is used in the power transmission mechanism, oil lubrication will be affected when the motor operates only in the low speed range. The power transmission mechanism will make noise and experience problems with service life and durability if the motor is operated at a speed higher than the rated speed.2.1 Section Safety YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual 372Mechanical Installation2.2 Mechanical Installation This section outlines specifications, procedures, and environment for proper
in the motor windings. nApplications with Specialized Motors Multi-Pole Motor Because the rated current will differ from a standard motor, be sure to check the maximum current when selecting a drive. Always stop the motor before switching between the number of motor poles. If a regen overvoltage (oV) fault occurs or if overcurrent protection (oC) is triggered, the motor will coast to stop. Submersible Motor Because motor rated current is greater than a standard motor, select the drive capacity accordingly. Be sure to use a large enough gauge motor cable to avoid decreasing the maximum torque level on account of voltage drop caused by a long motor cable.i.3 Application Precautions YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual 21Explosion-Proof Motor Both the motor and drive need to be tested together to be certified as explosion-proof. The drive is not designed for explosion proof areas. Furthermore, if an encoder is attached to an explosion-proof motor make sure the encoder is also explosion-proof. Use an insulating signal converter for connecting the encoder signal lines to the drives speed feedback option card. Geared Motor To avoid gear damage when operating at low speeds or very high speeds, make sure that both the gear and lubricant are rated for the desired speed range. Consult with the manufacturer for applications that require operation outside the rated speed range of the motor or gear box. Single-Phase Motor Variable speed AC drives
for continuous operation differs according to the lubrication method and motor manufacturer. If the motor is to be operated at a speed higher than the rated speed, consult with the manufacturer. Continuously operating an oil-lubricated motor in the low-speed range may result in burning.2.1 Section Safety 36 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical ManualNOTICE When the wiring distance is greater than 100 meters, pay special attention to the motor insulation voltage or use a drive-rated motor. Failure to comply could lead to motor winding failure. Motor vibration may increase when operating a machine in variable-speed mode, if that machine previously operated at a constant speed. Install vibration-proof rubber on the motor base or use the frequency jump function to skip a frequency resonating the machine. The motor may require more acceleration torque with drive operation than with a commercial power supply. Set a proper V/f pattern by checking the load torque characteristics of the machine to be used with the motor. The rated input current of submersible motors is higher than the rated input current of standard motors. Select an appropriate drive according to its rated output current. When the distance between the motor and drive is long, use a cable thick enough to connect the motor to the drive to prevent motor torque reduction. When using an explosion-proof motor, it must be subject to an explosion-proof test in conjunction with the drive. This
in an enclosure panel. Be sure to leave the required space between drives to provide for cooling, and that proper measures are taken so that the ambient temperature remains within allowable limits. Keep flammable materials away from the drive. If the drive must be used in an area where it is subjected to oil mist and excessive vibration, protective designs are available. Contact Yaskawa or your Yaskawa agent for details. nInstallation Direction The drive should be installed upright as specified in the manual. uSettings nMotor Code If using OLV/PM designed for permanent magnet motors (A1-02 = 5), make sure that the proper motor code is set in parameter E5-01 before performing a trial run. nUpper Limits The drive is capable of running the motor up to 400 Hz. Due to the danger of accidentally operating the motor at high speed, be sure to set the upper frequency limit. The default setting for the maximum output frequency is 60 Hz. nDC Injection Braking Motor overheat can result if there is too much current used during DC Injection Braking, or if the DC Injection Braking time is too long. nAcceleration/Deceleration Times Acceleration and deceleration times are affected by how much torque the motor generates, the load torque, and the inertia moment ((GD2)/4). Set a longer accel/decel time when Stall Prevention is enabled. The accel/decel times are lengthened for as long as the Stall Prevention function is operating. For faster acceleration and deceleration, install a braking

for continuous operation differs according to the lubrication method and motor manufacturer. If the motor is to be operated at a speed higher than the rated speed, consult with the manufacturer. Continuously operating an oil-lubricated motor in the low-speed range may result in burning.2.1 Section Safety 36 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical ManualNOTICE When the wiring distance is greater than 100 meters, pay special attention to the motor insulation voltage or use a drive-rated motor. Failure to comply could lead to motor winding failure. Motor vibration may increase when operating a machine in variable-speed mode, if that machine previously operated at a constant speed. Install vibration-proof rubber on the motor base or use the frequency jump function to skip a frequency resonating the machine. The motor may require more acceleration torque with drive operation than with a commercial power supply. Set a proper V/f pattern by checking the load torque characteristics of the machine to be used with the motor. The rated input current of submersible motors is higher than the rated input current of standard motors. Select an appropriate drive according to its rated output current. When the distance between the motor and drive is long, use a cable thick enough to connect the motor to the drive to prevent motor torque reduction. When using an explosion-proof motor, it must be subject to an explosion-proof test in conjunction with the drive. This
on Motor Operation nUsing a Standard Motor Low Speed Range The cooling fan of a standard motor is usually designed to sufficiently cool the motor at the rated speed. As the self-cooling capability of such a motor reduces with the speed, applying full torque at low speed will possibly damage the motor. To prevent motor damage from overheat, reduce the load torque as the motor slows. Figure i.4 shows the allowable load characteristics for a Yaskawa standard motor. A motor designed specifically for operation with a drive should be used when 100% continuous torque is needed at low speeds. 50 3 6 606070809010025% ED (or 15 min) 40% ED (or 20 min) 60% ED (or 40 min) Frequency (Hz)Continuous operationTorque (%) 20 Figure i.4 Allowable Load Characteristics for a Yaskawa Motor Insulation Tolerance Consider motor voltage tolerance levels and motor insulation in applications with an input voltage of over 440 V or particularly long wiring distances.

in an enclosure panel. Be sure to leave the required space between drives to provide for cooling, and that proper measures are taken so that the ambient temperature remains within allowable limits. Keep flammable materials away from the drive. If the drive must be used in an area where it is subjected to oil mist and excessive vibration, protective designs are available. Contact Yaskawa or your Yaskawa agent for details. nInstallation Direction The drive should be installed upright as specified in the manual. uSettings nMotor Code If using OLV/PM designed for permanent magnet motors (A1-02 = 5), make sure that the proper motor code is set in parameter E5-01 before performing a trial run. nUpper Limits The drive is capable of running the motor up to 400 Hz. Due to the danger of accidentally operating the motor at high speed, be sure to set the upper frequency limit. The default setting for the maximum output frequency is 60 Hz. nDC Injection Braking Motor overheat can result if there is too much current used during DC Injection Braking, or if the DC Injection Braking time is too long. nAcceleration/Deceleration Times Acceleration and deceleration times are affected by how much torque the motor generates, the load torque, and the inertia moment ((GD2)/4). Set a longer accel/decel time when Stall Prevention is enabled. The accel/decel times are lengthened for as long as the Stall Prevention function is operating. For faster acceleration and deceleration, install a braking
air circulation around the heatsink. This installation method still requires a certain amount of airflow over the drive case. Refer to Output Current Derating Due to Ambient Temperature on page 351 if derating is required. Contact a Yaskawa sales representative for more information. uNoise Filter Installation This drive has undergone testing in conformance with IEC/EN 61800-5-1 and is in compliance with low voltage directives. Refer to EMC Guidelines Compliance on page 469 for information on selecting a noise filter. uInstalling a Motor Thermal Overload (oL) Relay on the Drive Output Motor thermal overload relays protect the motor by disconnecting power lines to the motor due to a motor overload condition. Install a motor thermal overload relay between the drive and motor: • When operating multiple motors on a single AC drive. • When using a power line bypass to operate the motor directly from the power line. It is not necessary to install a motor thermal overload relay when operating a single motor from a single AC drive. The AC drive has UL recognized electronic motor overload protection built into the drive software. Note: Disable the motor protection function (L1-0 1 = “0”) when using an external motor thermal overload relay. The relay should shut off main power on the input side of the main circuit when triggered. nGeneral Precautions when Using Thermal Overload Relays The following application precautions should be considered when using motor thermal overload relays on

slightly in the opposite direction of the Run command depending on parameter settings and motor type. • The amount of starting torque that can be generated differs by each control mode and by the type of motor being used. Set up the motor with the drive after verifying the starting torque, allowable load characteristics, impact load tolerance, and speed control range. Contact Yaskawa or your Yaskawa agent if you plan to use a motor that does not fall within these specifications. • Braking Torque: In Open Loop Vector Control for PM motors, braking torque is less than 125% when running between 20% to 100% speed, even with a braking resistor. Braking torque drops to less than half when running at less than 20% speed. • Load Inertia: In Open Loop Vector Control for PM motors, the allowable load inertia moment is approximately 50 times higher than the motor inertia moment or less. Contact Yaskawa or your Yaskawa agent concerning applications with a larger inertia moment. • Holding Brake: When using a holding brake in Open Loop Vector Control for PM motors, release the brake prior to starting the motor. Failure to set the proper timing can result in speed loss. Not for use with conveyor, transport, or hoist type applications. • Restarting a Coasting Motor: To restart a coasting motor rotating at over 200 Hz while in the V/f control mode, use the Short Circuit Braking function to first bring the motor to a stop. Short Circuit Braking requires a special braking resistor. Contact

Selecting one of these Application Presets automatically sets the required parameters to the Application Preset default values and selects I/Os. In addition, the parameters most likely to be changed are assigned to the list of User Parameters, A2-01 through A2-16. These can be accessed in the Setup Mode and provide quicker application adjustment by eliminating the need to scroll through multiple menus. The following presets can be selected: Note: 1.Do not set any value outside the allowable range for A1-06. Setting an out-of-range value will cause “APPL” to flash on the display in the Setup group and disable the up and down arrow keys on the digital operator. To fix this error, press the ESC key to return to the Setup group and then it will then be possible to switch to another mode using the up and down arrow keys. 2.A1-06 setting can only be changed by initializing the drive by first setting A1-03 to 2220. Setting A1-06 to a value that is out of range will not adversely affect drive operation. When the drive should not be initialized because initialization will cause other problems, then A1-06 does not need to be changed.
Do not operate equipment with covers removed. Failure to comply could result in death or serious injury. The diagrams in this section may illustrate drives without covers or safety shields to display details. Be sure to reinstall covers or shields before operating the drives and run the drives according to the instructions described in this manual. Always ground the motor-side grounding terminal. Improper equipment grounding could result in death or serious injury by contacting the motor case. Do not touch terminals before the capacitors have fully discharged. Failure to comply could result in death or serious injury. Before wiring terminals, disconnect all power to the equipment. The internal capacitor remains charged even after the drive input power is turned off. The charge indicator LED will extinguish when the DC bus voltage is below 50 Vdc. To prevent electric shock, wait at least five minutes after all indicators are off and measure the DC bus voltage level to confirm safe level. Do not allow unqualified personnel to perform work on the drive. Failure to comply could result in death or serious injury. Installation, maintenance, inspection and servicing must be performed only by authorized personnel familiar with installation, adjustment and maintenance of AC drives.

Setting a Fixed User Defined Carrier Frequency A carrier frequency between the fixed selectable values can be entered in parameter C6-03 when C6-02 is set to “F”. In V/f Control, parameter C6-04 must also be adjusted to the same value as C6-03. Setting a Variable Carrier Frequency (V/f Control only) In V/f Control, the carrier frequency can be set up to change linearly with the output frequency. In this case the upper and lower limits for the carrier frequency and the carrier frequency proportional gain (C6-03, C6-04, C6-05) have to be set as shown in Figure 5.31.

If this is not appropriate for the application consider using a braking option. Figure 5.84 illustrates the function of Stall Prevention during deceleration. Output Frequency Deceleration characteristics when Stall Prevention was triggered during deceleration Time specified deceleration time Figure 5.84 Stall Prevention During Deceleration Setting 2: Intelligent Stall Prevention With this setting the drive adjusts the deceleration rate so that the DC bus voltage is kept at the level set in parameter L3-17. This way the shortest possible deceleration time is achieved while the motor is protected from stalling. The deceleration time that has been selected is disregarded, but the achievable deceleration time cannot be smaller than 1/10 of the set deceleration time. This function uses the following parameters for adjusting the deceleration rate: • DC bus voltage gain L3-20 • Deceleration rate calculations gain L3-21 • Inertia calculations for motor acceleration time L3-24 • Load inertia ratio L3-25 Refer to these parameter descriptions for details. Note: As the deceleration time is not constant, Intelligent Stall Prevention should not be used in applications where stopping accuracy is a concern.
Fault Name rHBraking Resistor Overheat Braking resistor protection was triggered. Fault detection is enabled when L8-01 = 1 (disabled as a default). Cause Possible Solution Deceleration time is too short and excessive regenerative energy is flowing back into the drive.• Check the load, deceleration time and speed. •Reduce the load. • Increase the acceleration and deceleration times (C1-01 through C1-08). • Replace the braking option with a larger device that can handle the power that is discharged.6.4 Fault Detection 278 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical ManualDigital Operator Display Fault Name Excessive braking inertia.Recalculate braking load and braking power.

Termination YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual 713Electrical Installation3.11 Braking Resistor Dynamic braking (DB) helps bring the motor to a smooth and rapid stop when working with high inertia loads. Regeneration occurs as the drive lowers the motor frequency with high inertia. When the regeneration flows back into the DC bus capacitors, an overvoltage situation occurs. A braking resistor prevents these overvoltage faults. NOTICE: Do not allow unqualified personnel to use the product. Failure to comply could result in damage to the drive or braking circuit. Carefully review the braking resistor instruction manual when connecting a braking option to the drive. Note: The braking circuit must be sized properly in order to dissipate the power required to decelerate the load in the desired time. Ensure that the braking circuit can dissipate the energy for the set deceleration time prior to running the drive. NOTICE: Use a thermal overload relay or over-temperature contact to interrupt input power to the drive if the braking resistor overheats. In the event of a possible thermal overload, the relay triggers the input contactor and prevents the braking resistor from burning up. uInstallation WARNING! Fire Hazard. The braking resistor connection terminals are B1 and B2. Do not connect a braking resistor directly to any other terminals.

Refer to DIP Switch S1 Analog Input Signal Selection on page 70. Selection for the sink/source mode is incorrect. Check DIP switch S3. Refer to Sinking/Sourcing Mode Switch on page 68. Frequency reference is too low.• Check the frequency reference monitor (U1-01). •Increase the frequency by changing the maximum output frequency ( E1-09). Multi-function analog input is set up to accept gain for the frequency reference, but no voltage (current) has been provided.• Check the multi-function analog input settings. • Check if analog input A1 or A2 is set for frequency reference gain (H3-02/10 = 1). If so, check if the correct signal is applied to the terminal. The gain and the frequency reference will be 0 if no signal is applied to the gain input. • Check if H3-02 and H3-10 have been set to the proper values. • Check if the analog input value has been set properly.

for the maximum output frequency is 60 Hz. nDC Injection Braking Motor overheat can result if there is too much current used during DC Injection Braking, or if the DC Injection Braking time is too long. nAcceleration/Deceleration Times Acceleration and deceleration times are affected by how much torque the motor generates, the load torque, and the inertia moment ((GD2)/4). Set a longer accel/decel time when Stall Prevention is enabled. The accel/decel times are lengthened for as long as the Stall Prevention function is operating. For faster acceleration and deceleration, install a braking option or increase the capacity of the drive. uGeneral Handling NOTICE: Wiring Check. Never connect the power supply lines to output terminals U/T1, V/T2, or W/T3. Doing so will destroy the drive. Be sure to perform a final check of all control wiring and other connections before applying line power. Make sure there are no short circuits on the control terminals (+V, AC, etc.), as this could damage the drive. nSelecting a Molded Case Circuit Breaker (MCCB) or Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) Yaskawa recommends installing a GFCI on the line power supply to protect drive wiring and prevent damage in the event of component failure. An MCCB may also be used if permitted by the power system. The GFCI should be designed for use with an AC drive (i.e., protected against harmonics) MCCB selection depends on the power factor for the drive, determined by the power supply voltage, output
it gets ready for operation (i.e. once the internal start up process is complete). WARNING! Sudden Movement Hazard. If b1-17 is set to 1 and an external Run command is active during power up, the motor will begin rotating as soon as the power is switched on. Proper precautions must be taken to ensure that the area around the motor is safe prior to powering up the drive. Failure to comply may cause serious injury. ub2: DC Injection Braking These parameters determine how the DC Injection Braking/Short Circuit Braking feature operates. Parameters involving the starting frequency, current level, braking time are located here. nb2-01: DC Injection Braking Start Frequency Active when “Ramp to Stop” is selected as the stopping method (b1-03 = 0). Sets the starting frequency for: •DC Injection Braking at stop in V/f and OLV control. • Short Circuit Braking at stop in PM OLV control. No. Name Setting Range Default b2-01 DC Injection Braking Start Frequency 0.0 to 10.0 Hz 0.5 Hz When the output frequency while ramping to stop drops below b2-01, the drive begins DC Injection/Short Circuit Braking in order to completely stop the motor at the end of deceleration. If b2-01 < E1-09 (Minimum Frequency), then DC Injection/ Short Circuit Braking begins at the frequency set to E1-09. No. Name Setting Range Default E1-09 Minimum Output Frequency 0.0 to 400.0 Hz <1> Determined by A1-02 and E1-03 and on E5-01 in OLV/PM. <1> The upper limit for the setting range is determined by E1-04.5.2 b:
by windmill effect), DC Injection or Speed Search should be used to either stop the motor or detect its speed before starting it. Otherwise motor stalling and other faults can occur. nb2-04: DC Injection Braking Time at Stop This parameter works in combination with b2-01, and sets the DC Injection Braking time at stop. Used to completely stop a motor with high inertia load after ramp down. Increase the setting if the motor tends to coast by inertia after a stop. No. Name Setting Range Default b2-04 DC Injection Braking Time at Stop 0.00 to 10.00 s 0.50 s nb2-08: Magnetic Flux Compensation Value Sets the magnetic flux compensation as a percentage of the no-load current value (E2-03) and can be used to increase the motor flux when the motor is started up. No. Name Setting Range Default b2-08 Magnetic Flux Compensation Value 0 to 1000% 0% This parameter allows the magnetizing motor flux to be boosted when starting the motor and thereby facilitate a quick ramp- up of the torque reference and magnetizing current reference in order to reduce motor slip during start. This flux level will be applied below the minimum output frequency set to E1-09 until the DC Injection time at start (b2-03) expires. It may be used to compensate for reduced starting torque due to motor circuit inefficiencies. nb2-12: Short Circuit Brake Time at Start Short-Circuit braking can be used in Open Loop Vector for PM motors. By shorting all three motor phases it produces a braking torque in the motor and
in an enclosure panel. Be sure to leave the required space between drives to provide for cooling, and that proper measures are taken so that the ambient temperature remains within allowable limits. Keep flammable materials away from the drive. If the drive must be used in an area where it is subjected to oil mist and excessive vibration, protective designs are available. Contact Yaskawa or your Yaskawa agent for details. nInstallation Direction The drive should be installed upright as specified in the manual. uSettings nMotor Code If using OLV/PM designed for permanent magnet motors (A1-02 = 5), make sure that the proper motor code is set in parameter E5-01 before performing a trial run. nUpper Limits The drive is capable of running the motor up to 400 Hz. Due to the danger of accidentally operating the motor at high speed, be sure to set the upper frequency limit. The default setting for the maximum output frequency is 60 Hz. nDC Injection Braking Motor overheat can result if there is too much current used during DC Injection Braking, or if the DC Injection Braking time is too long. nAcceleration/Deceleration Times Acceleration and deceleration times are affected by how much torque the motor generates, the load torque, and the inertia moment ((GD2)/4). Set a longer accel/decel time when Stall Prevention is enabled. The accel/decel times are lengthened for as long as the Stall Prevention function is operating. For faster acceleration and deceleration, install a braking

Failure to comply may cause the main body of the drive to fall, resulting in minor or moderate injury. NOTICE Observe proper electrostatic discharge procedures (ESD) when handling the drive and circuit boards. Failure to comply may result in ESD damage to the drive circuitry. A motor connected to a PWM drive may operate at a higher temperature than a utility-fed motor and the operating speed range may reduce motor cooling capacity. Ensure that the motor is suitable for drive duty and/or the motor service factor is adequate to accommodate the additional heating with the intended operating conditions.1.1 Section Safety 24 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual1.2 Model Number and Nameplate Check Please perform the following tasks after receiving the drive:

Selection When a momentary power loss occurs (DC bus voltage falls below the level set in L2-05), the drive can be set to automatically return to the operation it was performing when the power went out based on certain conditions. No. Name Setting Range Default L2-01 Momentary Power Loss Operation Selection 0 to 2 0 Setting 0: Disabled (default) If power is not restored within 15 ms, a Uv1 fault will result and the drive will stop the motor. Setting 1: Enabled, Recover Within L2-02 When a momentary power loss occurs, the drive will attempt to restart and perform Speed Search if power is restored within the period of time set to parameter L2-02. If power is not restored within the time set to L2-02 (i.e. DC bus voltage level remains below Uv1 detection level L2-05), then a Uv1 fault is triggered and the drive output will be shut off. Setting 2: Recover as Long as CPU has Power Drive will try to restart as long as the CPU still has power. This allows for a longer ride-through time than setting L2-01 to 1. A Uv1 fault is not triggered. This setting should also be used if the KEB function is utilized. Note: 1. The amount of time the drive is capable of recovering after a power loss is determined by the capacity of the drive. Drive capacity determines the upper limit for L2-02. 2.When L2-01 is set to 1 or 2, and a magnetic contactor between motor and drive is used, be sure that the magnetic contactor is kept close as long as the drive attempts to restart. 3.When L2-01 is set to 1

for continuous operation differs according to the lubrication method and motor manufacturer. If the motor is to be operated at a speed higher than the rated speed, consult with the manufacturer. Continuously operating an oil-lubricated motor in the low-speed range may result in burning.2.1 Section Safety 36 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical ManualNOTICE When the wiring distance is greater than 100 meters, pay special attention to the motor insulation voltage or use a drive-rated motor. Failure to comply could lead to motor winding failure. Motor vibration may increase when operating a machine in variable-speed mode, if that machine previously operated at a constant speed. Install vibration-proof rubber on the motor base or use the frequency jump function to skip a frequency resonating the machine. The motor may require more acceleration torque with drive operation than with a commercial power supply. Set a proper V/f pattern by checking the load torque characteristics of the machine to be used with the motor. The rated input current of submersible motors is higher than the rated input current of standard motors. Select an appropriate drive according to its rated output current. When the distance between the motor and drive is long, use a cable thick enough to connect the motor to the drive to prevent motor torque reduction. When using an explosion-proof motor, it must be subject to an explosion-proof test in conjunction with the drive. This
and deceleration times (C1-01 through C1-08). • Drive overloaded at low speeds. •Overload may occur at low speeds when using a general-purpose motor, even if operating within the rated current limitation.•Reduce the load. • Increase the speed. • If the drive is supposed to operate at low speeds, either increase the motor capacity or use a motor specifically designed to operate with the drive. Although a special type of motor is being used, the motor protection selection is set for a general-purpose motor (L1-01 = 1).Set L1-01 to 2. Voltage is too high for the V/f characteristics.• Adjust the user set V/f patterns (E1-04 through E1-10). Parameters E1-08 and E1-10 may need to be reduced. • If E1-08 and E1-10 are set too high, there may be very little load tolerance at low speed. The wrong motor-rated current is set to E2-01.• Check the motor-rated current. • Enter the value written on the motor nameplate to parameter E2-01. The motor base frequency for the drive input power is set too low.• Check the rated frequency indicated on the motor nameplate. • Enter the rated frequency to E1-06 (Base Frequency). Multiple motors are running off the same drive.Set L1-01 to 0 to disable the Motor Protection function and install a thermal relay to each motor. The electrical thermal protection characteristics and motor overload characteristics do not match.• Check the motor characteristics. • Correct the value set to L1-01 (Motor Protection Function). • Install an external thermal relay.
on Motor Operation nUsing a Standard Motor Low Speed Range The cooling fan of a standard motor is usually designed to sufficiently cool the motor at the rated speed. As the self-cooling capability of such a motor reduces with the speed, applying full torque at low speed will possibly damage the motor. To prevent motor damage from overheat, reduce the load torque as the motor slows. Figure i.4 shows the allowable load characteristics for a Yaskawa standard motor. A motor designed specifically for operation with a drive should be used when 100% continuous torque is needed at low speeds. 50 3 6 606070809010025% ED (or 15 min) 40% ED (or 20 min) 60% ED (or 40 min) Frequency (Hz)Continuous operationTorque (%) 20 Figure i.4 Allowable Load Characteristics for a Yaskawa Motor Insulation Tolerance Consider motor voltage tolerance levels and motor insulation in applications with an input voltage of over 440 V or particularly long wiring distances.

Contact the motor or machine manufacturer. Torque Characteristics Torque characteristics differ compared to operating the motor directly from line power. The user should have a full understanding of the load torque characteristics for the
situations. • Use Current Detection instead of Speed Estimation when operating motors smaller than 1.5 kW. Speed Estimation can end up stopping smaller motors as it might not be able to detect the speed or rotation direction of such small motors. • Use Short circuit Braking instead of Speed Estimation when using Open Loop Vector Control for PM motors along with a fairly long motor cable. • Use Short circuit Braking instead of Speed Estimation if attempting to find the speed of a motor coasting faster than 120 Hz in Open Loop Vector Control for PM motors. nCurrent Detection Type Speed Search (b3-24 = 0) Current Detection Speed Search can be applied to any motor. Be aware that sudden acceleration may occur when using Current Detection with relatively light loads. This method detects the motor speed by reducing the output frequency and measuring the current. The frequency reduction starts from the maximum output frequency or from the set frequency reference. As long as the output frequency is higher than the rotor speed, the slip will cause a high current. The closer the output frequency comes to the rotor speed, the lower the current draw will be. When the output current drops below the level as set in b3-02, the output frequency stops decreasing and normal operation resumes. The following time chart illustrates how Current Detection Speed Search operates after a momentary power loss:5.2 b: Application YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual

If this is not appropriate for the application consider using a braking option. Figure 5.84 illustrates the function of Stall Prevention during deceleration. Output Frequency Deceleration characteristics when Stall Prevention was triggered during deceleration Time specified deceleration time Figure 5.84 Stall Prevention During Deceleration Setting 2: Intelligent Stall Prevention With this setting the drive adjusts the deceleration rate so that the DC bus voltage is kept at the level set in parameter L3-17. This way the shortest possible deceleration time is achieved while the motor is protected from stalling. The deceleration time that has been selected is disregarded, but the achievable deceleration time cannot be smaller than 1/10 of the set deceleration time. This function uses the following parameters for adjusting the deceleration rate: • DC bus voltage gain L3-20 • Deceleration rate calculations gain L3-21 • Inertia calculations for motor acceleration time L3-24 • Load inertia ratio L3-25 Refer to these parameter descriptions for details. Note: As the deceleration time is not constant, Intelligent Stall Prevention should not be used in applications where stopping accuracy is a concern.
Interval Time Determines the amount of time to wait between attempts to restart the drive when parameter L5-05 is set to 1.

If a restart trial is successful, the restart counter is increased. This operation is repeated each time a fault occurs until the counter reaches the value set in L5-01. Setting 1: Count Restart Attempts The drive will try to restart using the time interval set in parameter L5-04. Each attempt is counted, whether it was successful or not. uL6: Torque Detection The drive provides two independent torque detection functions that trigger an alarm or fault signal when the load is too heavy (oL), or suddenly drops (UL). They are set up using the L6- oo parameters. To indicate the underload or overload condition to an external device, digital outputs should be programmed as shown below.

Restart the motor. •Increase the value of b2-03 (DC Injection Braking Time at start). • Enable Speed Search at start (b3-01 = “1”). •Set a multi-function input terminal for external Speed Search command (H1- oo=“61” or “62” during restart). nOutput Frequency is not as High as Frequency Reference Cause Possible Solutions Frequency reference is
at the active deceleration rate. If the load is too large or the deceleration time is too short, an ov fault may occur. 1: General Purpose - The drive decelerates at the active deceleration rate, but if the main circuit DC bus voltage reaches the Stall Prevention level, deceleration will stop. Deceleration will continue once the DC bus level drops below the Stall Prevention level. 2: Intelligent - The active deceleration rate is ignored and the drive decelerates as fast as possible without hitting ov fault level. Range: C1-02 / 10. 3: Stall Prevention with Braking Resistor - Stall Prevention during deceleration is enabled in coordination with dynamic braking. 4: Overexcitation Deceleration - Decelerates with the flux level determined by n3-13 (Overexcitation Gain). 7: Overexcitation Deceleration 3 - Applies more braking power than normal overexcitation deceleration. Yaskawa recommends extra caution due to the heavy load on the motor.0 to 4; 7 <9> 1 S S S 492 223 L3-05 Stall Prevention Selection during Run Selects the Stall Prevention method to use to prevent drive faults during run. 0: Disabled - Drive runs a set frequency.

For proper drive protection and operation leave the Software CLA function enabled. No. Name Setting Range Default L8-18 Software Current Limit Selection 0 or 1<1> <1> Default setting is determined by drive software version and C6-02 setting. Drive software versions PRG: 1021 and later have a default setting of 0 when the carrier frequency is set for Leakage Current Rejection PWM (C6-02 = B), and 1 when C6-02 is set to any other value. Setting 0: Disabled The drive may trip on an oC fault if the load is too heavy or the acceleration is too short.

for explosion proof areas. Furthermore, if an encoder is attached to an explosion-proof motor make sure the encoder is also explosion-proof. Use an insulating signal converter for connecting the encoder signal lines to the drives speed feedback option card. Geared Motor To avoid gear damage when operating at low speeds or very high speeds, make sure that both the gear and lubricant are rated for the desired speed range. Consult with the manufacturer for applications that require operation outside the rated speed range of the motor or gear box. Single-Phase Motor Variable speed AC drives are not designed for operation with single phase motors. Using capacitors to start the motor causes excessive current to flow and can damage drive components. A split-phase start or a repulsion start can end up burning out the starter coils because the internal centrifugal switch is not activated. The drive is for use with 3-phase motors only. Motor with Brake Caution should be taken when using a drive to operate a motor with a built-in holding brake. If the brake is connected to the output side of the drive, it may not release at start due to low voltage levels. A separate power supply should be installed for the motor brake. Motors with a built-in brake tend to generate a fair amount of noise when running at low speeds. nPower Driven Machinery (decelerators, belts, chains, etc.) Continuous operation at low speeds wears on the lubricating material used in gear box type systems to accelerate
operation than with a commercial power supply. Set a proper V/f pattern by checking the load torque characteristics of the machine to be used with the motor. The rated input current of submersible motors is higher than the rated input current of standard motors. Select an appropriate drive according to its rated output current. When the distance between the motor and drive is long, use a cable thick enough to connect the motor to the drive to prevent motor torque reduction. When using an explosion-proof motor, it must be subject to an explosion-proof test in conjunction with the drive. This is also applicable when an existing explosion-proof motor is to be operated with the drive. Since the drive itself is not explosion-proof, always install it in a safe place. Be sure to set A1-02 to “0” when using an explosion-proof motor. Do not use a drive for a single-phase motor. Replace the motor with a three-phase motor. If an oil-lubricated gearbox or speed reducer is used in the power transmission mechanism, oil lubrication will be affected when the motor operates only in the low speed range. The power transmission mechanism will make noise and experience problems with service life and durability if the motor is operated at a speed higher than the rated speed.2.1 Section Safety YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual 372Mechanical Installation2.2 Mechanical Installation This section outlines specifications, procedures, and environment for proper
in the motor windings. nApplications with Specialized Motors Multi-Pole Motor Because the rated current will differ from a standard motor, be sure to check the maximum current when selecting a drive. Always stop the motor before switching between the number of motor poles. If a regen overvoltage (oV) fault occurs or if overcurrent protection (oC) is triggered, the motor will coast to stop. Submersible Motor Because motor rated current is greater than a standard motor, select the drive capacity accordingly. Be sure to use a large enough gauge motor cable to avoid decreasing the maximum torque level on account of voltage drop caused by a long motor cable.i.3 Application Precautions YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual 21Explosion-Proof Motor Both the motor and drive need to be tested together to be certified as explosion-proof. The drive is not designed for explosion proof areas. Furthermore, if an encoder is attached to an explosion-proof motor make sure the encoder is also explosion-proof. Use an insulating signal converter for connecting the encoder signal lines to the drives speed feedback option card. Geared Motor To avoid gear damage when operating at low speeds or very high speeds, make sure that both the gear and lubricant are rated for the desired speed range. Consult with the manufacturer for applications that require operation outside the rated speed range of the motor or gear box. Single-Phase Motor Variable speed AC drives
for continuous operation differs according to the lubrication method and motor manufacturer. If the motor is to be operated at a speed higher than the rated speed, consult with the manufacturer. Continuously operating an oil-lubricated motor in the low-speed range may result in burning.2.1 Section Safety 36 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical ManualNOTICE When the wiring distance is greater than 100 meters, pay special attention to the motor insulation voltage or use a drive-rated motor. Failure to comply could lead to motor winding failure. Motor vibration may increase when operating a machine in variable-speed mode, if that machine previously operated at a constant speed. Install vibration-proof rubber on the motor base or use the frequency jump function to skip a frequency resonating the machine. The motor may require more acceleration torque with drive operation than with a commercial power supply. Set a proper V/f pattern by checking the load torque characteristics of the machine to be used with the motor. The rated input current of submersible motors is higher than the rated input current of standard motors. Select an appropriate drive according to its rated output current. When the distance between the motor and drive is long, use a cable thick enough to connect the motor to the drive to prevent motor torque reduction. When using an explosion-proof motor, it must be subject to an explosion-proof test in conjunction with the drive. This
