It should be used whenever PID control is enabled to prevent critical machine conditions (e.g. acceleration to max. frequency) caused by a feedback loss. Feedback loss can be detected in two ways: •Feedback Low Detection: Detected when the feedback falls below a certain level for longer than the specified time. •Feedback High Detection : Detected when the feedback rises beyond a certain level for longer than the specified time. The following figure explains the working principle of feedback loss detection when the feedback signal is too low. Feedback high detection works in the same way.

Auto-Tuning has not yet been performed (required for Open Loop Vector Control).Perform Auto-Tuning. Set motor parameters after calculating the proper values. Change the motor control method to V/f Control ( A1-02 = “0”). Insufficient tuning in V/f Control.Reduce the gain. •n1-02 (Hunting Prevention Gain Setting) • n1-03 (Hunting Prevention Time Constant Setting) Gain is too low when using PID control. Check the period of oscillation and adjust P, I, and D settings accordingly. The frequency reference is assigned to an external source and the signal is noisy.• Ensure that noise is not affecting the signal lines. •Separate main circuit wiring and control circuit wiring. • Use twisted-pair cables or shielded wiring for the control circuit. • Increase the analog input time filter constant (H3-13). The cable between the drive and motor is too long.• Perform Auto-Tuning. •Reduce the length of the cable. nPID Output Fault Cause Possible Solutions No PID feedback input.• Check the multi-function analog input terminal settings. • Set multi-function analog input terminal A1 or A2 for PID feedback (H3-02 or H3-10 = “B”). • A signal input to the terminal selection for PID feedback is necessary. • Check the connection of the feedback signal. • Check the various PID-related parameter settings. • No PID feedback input to the terminal causes the value detected to be 0, causing a PID

Occurs When Running at a Constant Speed Cause Possible Solutions Excessive load inertia in Open Loop Vector Control.• Loads with a lot of inertia (fans, etc.) can trigger an overvoltage fault when operating in Open Loop Vector Control. • Switch to the V/f motor control method. • Adjust the values set for the speed feedback detection control time constant (n2-02, n2-03). nMotor Stalls During Acceleration or With Large Loads Cause Possible Solutions Load is too heavy.Take the following steps to resolve the problem: •Reduce the load. • Increase the acceleration time. • Increase motor capacity. • Although the drive has a Stall Prevention function and a Torque Compensation Limit function, accelerating too quickly or trying to drive an excessively large load can exceed the capabilities of the motor. nMotor Will Not Accelerate or the Acceleration Time is Too Long Cause Possible Solutions Frequency reference is too low.• Check the maximum output frequency (E1-04). •Increase E1-04 if it is set too low. Check U1-01 for proper frequency reference. Check if a frequency reference signal switch has been set to one of the multi-function input terminals. Check for low gain level set to terminals A1 or A2 (H3-03, H3-11). Load is too heavy.• Reduce the load so that the output current remains within the motor-rated current. • In extruder and mixer applications, the load will sometimes increase as the temperature drops. Check if the mechanical brake is fully releasing as it should. The torque

Set the torque limit to the most appropriate setting (L7-01 through L7-04). Load inertia is too big.• Adjust the deceleration time (C1-02, -04, -06, -08). •Set the frequency to the minimum value and interrupt the run command when the drive finishes decelerating. Digital Operator Display Fault Name CoFCurrent Offset Fault The current sensor is damaged or there was residual induction current in the motor (e.g., during sudden deceleration or when coasting) when the drive attempted to start the motor. Cause Possible Solution6.4 Fault Detection YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual 2676TroubleshootingDigital Operator Display Fault Name Due to residual induction current in the motor when the drive attempted to start the motor, the drive attempted to adjust the current offset value beyond the allowable range.• Create a motor restart sequence that allows enough time for the residual induction voltage to dissipate. • Enable Speed Search at start (b3-01 = 1). Use the multi-function terminals to execute External Speed Search 1 and 2 (H1-oo = 61 or 62). Note: When using a PM motor, both External Speed Search 1 and 2 perform the same operation.

slightly in the opposite direction of the Run command depending on parameter settings and motor type. • The amount of starting torque that can be generated differs by each control mode and by the type of motor being used. Set up the motor with the drive after verifying the starting torque, allowable load characteristics, impact load tolerance, and speed control range. Contact Yaskawa or your Yaskawa agent if you plan to use a motor that does not fall within these specifications. • Braking Torque: In Open Loop Vector Control for PM motors, braking torque is less than 125% when running between 20% to 100% speed, even with a braking resistor. Braking torque drops to less than half when running at less than 20% speed. • Load Inertia: In Open Loop Vector Control for PM motors, the allowable load inertia moment is approximately 50 times higher than the motor inertia moment or less. Contact Yaskawa or your Yaskawa agent concerning applications with a larger inertia moment. • Holding Brake: When using a holding brake in Open Loop Vector Control for PM motors, release the brake prior to starting the motor. Failure to set the proper timing can result in speed loss. Not for use with conveyor, transport, or hoist type applications. • Restarting a Coasting Motor: To restart a coasting motor rotating at over 200 Hz while in the V/f control mode, use the Short Circuit Braking function to first bring the motor to a stop. Short Circuit Braking requires a special braking resistor. Contact

Sudden Movement Hazard. Do not attempt to move a load that could potentially rotate the motor faster than the maximum allowable r/min when the drive has been shut off. Unpredictable equipment operation may result in death or serious injury. NOTICE: Do not open and close the motor disconnect switch while the motor is running, as this may damage the drive. NOTICE: If the motor is coasting, make sure the power to the drive is turned on and the drive output has completely stopped before closing the load switch. nWiring All wire ends should use ring terminals for UL/cUL compliance. Use only the tools recommended by the terminal manufacturer for crimping. nTransporting the Drive NOTICE: Prevent the drive from contact with salts, fluorine, bromine, phthalate ester, and other such harmful chemicals. Never steam clean the drive. Failure to comply may cause damage to the drive components. uNotes on Motor Operation nUsing a Standard Motor Low Speed Range The cooling fan of a standard motor is usually designed to sufficiently cool the motor at the rated speed. As the self-cooling capability of such a motor reduces with the speed, applying full torque at low speed will possibly damage the motor. To prevent motor damage from overheat, reduce the load torque as the motor slows. Figure i.4 shows the allowable load characteristics for a Yaskawa standard motor. A motor designed specifically for operation with a drive should be used when 100% continuous torque is needed at low speeds. 50 3 6

WARNING! Electrical Shock Hazard. When executing stationary Auto-Tuning for line-to-line resistance only, the motor does not rotate, however, power is applied. Do not touch the motor until Auto-Tuning is completed. Failure to comply may result in injury from electrical shock. uAuto-Tuning Interruption and Fault Codes If tuning results are abnormal or the STOP key is pressed before completion, Auto-Tuning will be interrupted and a fault code will be displayed on the digital operator. A B A – Normal Auto-Tuning Display B – Auto-Tuning Interrupted Figure 4.12 Auto-Tuning Interruption Display uPerforming Auto-Tuning nAuto-Tuning Procedure Auto-Tuning should generally be performed in the following steps. 1.Refer to Before Auto-Tuning the Drive on page 102. 2.Determine which type of Auto-Tuning best fits the application requirements following Figure 4.13.4.7 Auto-Tuning YASKAWA
106. 2.For Stationary Auto-Tuning for Line-to-Line resistance only, set T1-02 and T1-04. nStarting Auto-Tuning WARNING! Sudden Movement Hazard. The drive and motor may start unexpectedly during Auto-Tuning, which could result in death or serious injury. Ensure the area surrounding the drive motor and load are clear before proceeding with Auto-Tuning. WARNING! Electrical Shock Hazard. High voltage will be supplied to the motor when Stationary Auto-Tuning is performed even with the motor stopped, which could result in death or serious injury. Do not touch the motor until Auto-Tuning has been completed. NOTICE: Rotational Auto-Tuning will not function properly if a holding brake is engaged on the load. Failure to comply could result in improper operation of the drive. Ensure the motor can freely spin before beginning Auto-Tuning.4.7 Auto-Tuning YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual 1054Start-Up Programming & OperationNOTICE: Never perform Rotational Auto-Tuning for a motor connected to a load. Failure to comply could result in improper drive operation. If Rotational Auto-Tuning is performed for a motor coupled to a load, the motor parameters will be inaccurate and the motor may exhibit abnormal operation. Disconnect or decouple the motor from the load. Enter the required information from the motor nameplate. Press to proceed to the Auto-Tuning start display.

Refer to PID Block Diagram on page 138 for more information on this function. Setting 40/41: Forward Run/Reverse Run Command for 2-Wire Sequence Sets the drive for 2-Wire sequence. When the input set to 40 is closed, the drive operates in the forward direction. When the input set for 41 is closed, the drive will operate in reverse. Closing both inputs at the same time will result in an external fault. Note: 1. This function cannot be used simultaneously with settings 42 and 43. 2.These functions are assigned to the terminals S1 and S2 when the drive is initialized for 2-Wire sequence. 3.Software versions PRG: 1013 and later require that both Forward run and Reverse Run commands be set at the same time.

Bias Operation Mode Selection (Up/Down 2) Determines if the bias value is held or not when the Up/Down 2 inputs are both released or both enabled. The parameter is effective only when parameter d4-03 is set to 0.00. No. Parameter Name Setting Range Default d4-05 Frequency Reference Bias Operation Mode Selection 0 or 1 0 Setting 0: Hold Bias Value The bias value will be held if no input Up 2 or Down 2 is active. Setting 1: Reset Bias Value The bias is reset to 0% when both inputs Up 2 and Down 2 are either on or off. The drive will use the accel/decel time as selected in d4-04 to accelerate or decelerate to the frequency reference value. nd4-06: Frequency Reference Bias (Up/Down 2) This parameter is used to save the frequency reference bias value set by the Up/Down 2 function. It is set as a percentage of the maximum output frequency. The function of d4-06 depends on how the Up/Down 2 function is configured. • This parameter is not normally used when the frequency reference is set by the digital operator. The user can set d4-06 to a certain value that will be applied when the operation is started, but it will be reset when the frequency reference changes (including multi-step references) or will be disabled when d4-01 = 0 and the Run command is removed. • When d4-01 = 0 and the frequency reference is set by an analog or pulse input, the value set in d4-06 is generally added to or subtracted from the frequency reference. • When d4-01 = 1 and the frequency reference is set by a
accelerates up to the frequency reference plus d4-03 (bias is increased for d4-03). •When Down 2 is enabled, drive decelerates down to the frequency reference minus d4-03 (bias is decreased for d4-03). • Holds output frequency (holds the bias) when no Up 2 or Down 2 input or both active. • Resets the bias when the reference changes • Operates with the frequency reference in all other situations.Not saved 5 1If the bias and frequency reference are constant for 5 s, the bias is added to the active frequency reference and reset afterwards. 6 Other (analog communicati ons, etc.)0 00 • Accelerates (increases the bias) while the Up 2 function is closed •Decelerates (decreases the bias) while Down 2 is closed • Holds output frequency (holds the bias) when no Up 2 or Down 2 input or both active. • When during accel/decel. the frequency reference changes for more than d4-07, bias value is held until the output frequency meets the reference (speed agree).Not saved 7 1If the bias is constant for 5 s, it is saved to parameter d4-06. The frequency reference cannot be overwritten, so only the bias is saved.5.7 H: Terminal Functions YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual 1935Parameter DetailsConditionFreq.

No. Parameter Name Setting Range Default d4-07 Analog Frequency Reference Fluctuation Limit 0.1 to 100.0% 1.0% nd4-08: Frequency Reference Bias Upper Limit (Up/Down 2) Parameter d4-08 sets the upper limit of the Up/Down 2 bias (monitor U6-20) and the value that can be saved in parameter d4-06. Set this parameter to an appropriate value before using the Up/Down 2 function. Note: When the frequency reference is set by the digital operator (b1-01 = 0) and d4-01 = 1, the bias value will be added to the frequency reference if no Up/Down 2 command is received for 5 s, and will be reset to 0 afterwards. From that point the bias can be increased up to the limit set in d4-08 again.5.4 d: Reference Settings 166 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical ManualNo. Parameter Name Setting Range Default d4-08 Frequency Reference Bias Upper Limit 0.0 to 100.0%<1> <1> Default setting is determined by the software version.
