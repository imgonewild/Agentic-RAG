If ventilation is not adequate, use respiratory protection equipment. Select and use eye/face protection to prevent contact based on the results of an exposure assessment. The following eye/face protection(s) are recommended: Indirect Vented Goggles Skin/hand protection Select and use gloves and/or protective clothing approved to relevant local standards to prevent skin contact based on the results of an exposure assessment. Selection should be based on use factors such as exposure levels, concentration of the substance or mixture, frequency and duration, physical challenges such as temperature extremes, and other use conditions. Consult with your glove and/or protective clothing manufacturer for selection of appropriate compatible gloves/protective clothing. Gloves made from the following material(s) are recommended: Nitrile Rubber Respiratory protection An exposure assessment may be needed to decide if a respirator is required. If a respirator is needed, use respirators as part of a full respiratory protection program. Based on the results of the exposure assessment, select from the following respirator type(s) to reduce inhalation exposure: Half facepiece or full facepiece supplied-air respirator Organic vapor respirators may have short service life.']","['SECTION 8: Exposure controls/personal protection, SECTION 9: Physical and chemical properties']"
