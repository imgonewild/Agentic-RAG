occurs when there is insufficient torque, it is likely that the demand on the motor has exceeded the motor capacity. •Use a larger motor. Reaching the torque limit.• Check the settings for the torque limit (L7-01 through L7-04). •If the torque limit is enabled, deceleration might take longer than expected because the drive cannot output more torque than the limit setting. Ensure the torque limit is set to a large enough value. • Increase the torque limit setting. • If multi-function analog input terminal A1 or A2 is set to torque limit (H3-02 or H3-10 equals 10, 11, 12, or 15), ensure that the analog input levels are set to the correct levels. • Ensure H3-02 and H3-10 are set to the right levels. • Ensure the analog input is set to the correct value.

Refer to Selecting the Appropriate Load Rating on page 342 for the differences between HD and ND. Specifications for capacity ratings are listed on the following pages. Table A.1 Selecting

more acceleration torque with drive operation than with a commercial power supply. Set a proper V/f pattern by checking the load torque characteristics of the machine to be used with the motor. The rated input current of submersible motors is higher than the rated input current of standard motors. Select an appropriate drive according to its rated output current. When the distance between the motor and drive is long, use a cable thick enough to connect the motor to the drive to prevent motor torque reduction. When using an explosion-proof motor, it must be subject to an explosion-proof test in conjunction with the drive. This is also applicable when an existing explosion-proof motor is to be operated with the drive. Since the drive itself is not explosion-proof, always install it in a safe place. Be sure to set A1-02 to “0” when using an explosion-proof motor. Do not use a drive for a single-phase motor. Replace the motor with a three-phase motor. If an oil-lubricated gearbox or speed reducer is used in the power transmission mechanism, oil lubrication will be affected when the motor operates only in the low speed range. The power transmission mechanism will make noise and experience problems with service life and durability if the motor is operated at a speed higher than the rated speed.2.1 Section Safety YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual 372Mechanical Installation2.2 Mechanical Installation This section outlines specifications,
or hoist type applications. • Restarting a Coasting Motor: To restart a coasting motor rotating at over 200 Hz while in the V/f control mode, use the Short Circuit Braking function to first bring the motor to a stop. Short Circuit Braking requires a special braking resistor. Contact Yaskawa or your Yaskawa agent for details. Speed Search can be used to restart a coasting motor rotating slower than 200 Hz. If the motor cable is relatively long, however, the motor should instead be stopped using Short Circuit Braking, which forces the motor to stop by creating a short-circuit in the motor windings. nApplications with Specialized Motors Multi-Pole Motor Because the rated current will differ from a standard motor, be sure to check the maximum current when selecting a drive. Always stop the motor before switching between the number of motor poles. If a regen overvoltage (oV) fault occurs or if overcurrent protection (oC) is triggered, the motor will coast to stop. Submersible Motor Because motor rated current is greater than a standard motor, select the drive capacity accordingly. Be sure to use a large enough gauge motor cable to avoid decreasing the maximum torque level on account of voltage drop caused by a long motor cable.i.3 Application Precautions YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual 21Explosion-Proof Motor Both the motor and drive need to be tested together to be certified as explosion-proof. The drive is not designed for explosion
range whenever using a standard blower cooled motor. If 100% torque is required continuously at low speed, consider using a special drive or vector motor. Select a motor that is compatible with the required load torque and operating speed range. Do not operate motors above the maximum rated RPM. Failure to comply may lead to bearing or other mechanical motor failures. The speed range for continuous operation differs according to the lubrication method and motor manufacturer. If the motor is to be operated at a speed higher than the rated speed, consult with the manufacturer. Continuously operating an oil-lubricated motor in the low-speed range may result in burning.2.1 Section Safety 36 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical ManualNOTICE When the wiring distance is greater than 100 meters, pay special attention to the motor insulation voltage or use a drive-rated motor. Failure to comply could lead to motor winding failure. Motor vibration may increase when operating a machine in variable-speed mode, if that machine previously operated at a constant speed. Install vibration-proof rubber on the motor base or use the frequency jump function to skip a frequency resonating the machine. The motor may require more acceleration torque with drive operation than with a commercial power supply. Set a proper V/f pattern by checking the load torque characteristics of the machine to be used with the motor. The rated input current of submersible motors is

Contact the motor or machine manufacturer. Torque Characteristics Torque characteristics differ compared to operating the motor directly from line power. The user should have a full understanding of the load torque characteristics for the application. Vibration and Shock The drive settings allow the user to choose between high carrier PWM control and low carrier PWM. Selecting high carrier PWM
range whenever using a standard blower cooled motor. If 100% torque is required continuously at low speed, consider using a special drive or vector motor. Select a motor that is compatible with the required load torque and operating speed range. Do not operate motors above the maximum rated RPM. Failure to comply may lead to bearing or other mechanical motor failures. The speed range for continuous operation differs according to the lubrication method and motor manufacturer. If the motor is to be operated at a speed higher than the rated speed, consult with the manufacturer. Continuously operating an oil-lubricated motor in the low-speed range may result in burning.2.1 Section Safety 36 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical ManualNOTICE When the wiring distance is greater than 100 meters, pay special attention to the motor insulation voltage or use a drive-rated motor. Failure to comply could lead to motor winding failure. Motor vibration may increase when operating a machine in variable-speed mode, if that machine previously operated at a constant speed. Install vibration-proof rubber on the motor base or use the frequency jump function to skip a frequency resonating the machine. The motor may require more acceleration torque with drive operation than with a commercial power supply. Set a proper V/f pattern by checking the load torque characteristics of the machine to be used with the motor. The rated input current of submersible motors is
when running at rated nameplate base frequency (check the motor specifications).Continuous operation at less than line power frequency with 100% load can trigger motor overload protection (oL1). A fault is output and the motor will coast to stop. Setting 2: Drive Dedicated Motor (constant torque, 1:10) Use this setting when operating a drive duty motor with a torque ratio of 1:10. This motor type is allowed to run with 100% load from 10% up to 100% speed. Running slower speeds with full load can trigger an overload fault.5.8 L: Protection Functions YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual 2135Parameter DetailsOverload Tolerance Cooling Ability Overload Characteristics 100150 110 100120 167 20055 50 0Rated Speed=100% Speed 60 sec.

Reaching the torque limit.• Check the settings for the torque limit (L7-01 through L7-04). •If the torque limit is enabled, deceleration might take longer than expected because the drive cannot output more torque than the limit setting. Ensure the torque limit is set to a large enough value. • Increase the torque limit setting. • If multi-function analog input terminal A1 or A2 is set to torque limit (H3-02 or H3-10 equals 10, 11, 12, or 15), ensure that the analog input levels are set to the correct levels. • Ensure H3-02 and H3-10 are set to the right levels. • Ensure the analog input is set to the correct value. Load exceeded the internal torque limit determined by the drive rated current.Switch to a larger capacity drive.6.9 Troubleshooting without Fault Display 304 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical ManualnMotor Hunting Occurs When Operating With a Light Load Cause Possible Solutions Carrier frequency is too high. Lower the carrier frequency setting C6-02.

36 2.2 MECHANICAL INSTALLATION.............................................................................382 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual 352.1 Section Safety WARNING Fire Hazard Provide sufficient cooling when installing the drive inside an enclosed panel or cabinet. Failure to comply could result in overheating and fire. When multiple drives are placed inside the same enclosure panel, install proper cooling to ensure air entering the enclosure does not exceed 40 °C. CAUTION Crush Hazard Do not carry the drive by the front cover. Failure to comply may result in minor or moderate injury from the main body of the drive falling. NOTICE Observe proper electrostatic discharge (ESD) procedures when handling the drive. Failure to comply could result in ESD damage to the drive circuitry. It may be difficult to perform maintenance on the cooling fans of drives installed in a vertical row inside an enclosure. Ensure adequate spacing at the top of the drive to perform cooling fan replacement when required. Operating the motor in the low-speed range diminishes the cooling effects, increases motor temperature, and may lead to motor damage by overheating. Reduce the motor torque in the low-speed range whenever using a standard blower cooled motor. If 100% torque is required continuously at low speed, consider using a special drive or vector motor. Select a motor that is compatible with the required load torque and operating speed range. Do

NOTICE: Prevent foreign matter such as metal shavings or wire clippings from falling into the drive during installation and project construction. Failure to comply could result in damage to the drive. Place a temporary cover over the top of the drive during installation. Remove the temporary cover before startup, as the cover will reduce ventilation and cause the drive to overheat. NOTICE: Avoid placing drive peripheral devices, transformers, or other electronics near the drive. Failure to comply could result in erroneous operation. If such devices must be used in close proximity to the drive, take proper steps to shield the drive from noise. uInstallation Orientation and Spacing Install the drive upright as illustrated in Figure 2.1 to maintain proper cooling.

selection. uAttachment for External Heatsink An external attachment can be used to project the heatsink outside of an enclosure to ensure that there is sufficient air circulation around the heatsink. This installation method still requires a certain amount of airflow over the drive case. Refer to Output Current Derating Due to Ambient Temperature on page 351 if derating is required. Contact a Yaskawa sales representative for more information. uNoise Filter Installation This drive has undergone testing in conformance with IEC/EN 61800-5-1 and is in compliance with low voltage directives. Refer to EMC Guidelines Compliance on page 469 for information on selecting a noise filter. uInstalling a Motor Thermal Overload (oL) Relay on the Drive Output Motor thermal overload relays protect the motor by disconnecting power lines to the motor due to a motor overload condition. Install a motor thermal overload relay between the drive and motor: • When operating multiple motors on a single AC drive. • When using a power line bypass to operate the motor directly from the power line. It is not necessary to install a motor thermal overload relay when operating a single motor from a single AC drive. The AC drive has UL recognized electronic motor overload protection built into the drive software. Note: Disable the motor protection function (L1-0 1 = “0”) when using an external motor thermal overload relay. The relay should shut off main power on the input side of the main circuit when

start, a synchronous motor may rotate slightly in the opposite direction of the Run command depending on parameter settings and motor type. • The amount of starting torque that can be generated differs by each control mode and by the type of motor being used. Set up the motor with the drive after verifying the starting torque, allowable load characteristics, impact load tolerance, and speed control range. Contact Yaskawa or your Yaskawa agent if you plan to use a motor that does not fall within these specifications. • Braking Torque: In Open Loop Vector Control for PM motors, braking torque is less than 125% when running between 20% to 100% speed, even with a braking resistor. Braking torque drops to less than half when running at less than 20% speed. • Load Inertia: In Open Loop Vector Control for PM motors, the allowable load inertia moment is approximately 50 times higher than the motor inertia moment or less. Contact Yaskawa or your Yaskawa agent concerning applications with a larger inertia moment. • Holding Brake: When using a holding brake in Open Loop Vector Control for PM motors, release the brake prior to starting the motor. Failure to set the proper timing can result in speed loss. Not for use with conveyor, transport, or hoist type applications. • Restarting a Coasting Motor: To restart a coasting motor rotating at over 200 Hz while in the V/f control mode, use the Short Circuit Braking function to first bring the motor to a stop. Short Circuit Braking requires a
rated torque. 2.In V/f Control and Open Loop Vector Control for PM, the level is set as a percentage of the drive rated output current. In Open Loop Vector, it is set as a percentage of the motor rated torque. Note: When overtorque occurs in the application, the drive may stop due to overcurrent (oC) or overload (oL1). To prevent this, an overload situation should be indicated to the controller before oC or oL1 occur in the drive. Use the torque detection for this purpose. Use undertorque detection to discover application problems like a torn belt, a pump shutting off, or other similar trouble. nL6-01/L6-04: Torque Detection Selection 1/2 The torque detection function is triggered when the current/torque exceeds the levels set in parameter L6-02/L6-05 for longer than the time set in L6-03L6-/06. The parameters L6-01/L6-04 select the detection condition and the operation at detection.

It may be used to compensate for reduced starting torque due to motor circuit inefficiencies. nb2-12: Short Circuit Brake Time at Start Short-Circuit braking can be used in Open Loop Vector for PM motors. By shorting all three motor phases it produces a braking torque in the motor and can be used to stop a coasting motor before starting it.

Speed Control Accuracy Cause Possible Solutions Drive reached the slip compensation limit.• Check the slip compensation limit (C3-03). •Increase the value set to C3-03. Motor-rated voltage is set too high in Open Loop Vector Control.• The input voltage for the drive determines the maximum output voltage. A drive with an input of 200 Vac can only output a maximum of 200 Vac. Open Loop Vector Control sometimes calculates an output voltage reference value that exceeds the maximum drive output voltage level, resulting in a loss of speed control accuracy. • Use a motor with a lower voltage rating (a vector control motor). • Increase the input power voltage. Auto-Tuning did not complete properly for Open Loop Vector Control.• Perform Auto-Tuning again. nDeceleration Takes Longer Than Expected with Dynamic Braking Enabled Cause Possible Solutions L3-04 is set incorrectly.• Check the Stall Prevention Level during deceleration (L3-04). •If a braking resistor option has been installed, disable Stall Prevention during deceleration (L3-04 = “0”). The deceleration time is set too long. Set deceleration to more appropriate time (C1-02, C1-04, C1-06, C1-08). Insufficient motor torque.• Assuming parameter settings are normal and that no overvoltage occurs when there is insufficient torque, it is likely that the demand on the motor has exceeded the motor capacity. •Use a larger motor.

Yaskawa recommends lowering the carrier frequency, particularly when audible noise is not a concern. The user can also choose to reduce the load, increase the acceleration and deceleration times, or switch to a larger drive. This will help keep peak current levels under 150%. Be sure to check the peak current levels when starting and stopping repeatedly during the initial test run, and make adjustments accordingly.i.3 Application Precautions 18 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical ManualuInstallation Environment nEnclosure Panels Keep the drive in a clean environment by either selecting an area free of airborne dust, lint, and oil mist, or install the drive in an enclosure panel. Be sure to leave the required space between drives to provide for cooling, and that proper measures are taken so that the ambient temperature remains within allowable limits. Keep flammable materials away from the drive. If the drive must be used in an area where it is subjected to oil mist and excessive vibration, protective designs are available.

important to perform preventive maintenance and periodic inspection on the drive. Drives contain a variety of power electronics such as power transistors, semiconductors, capacitors, resistors, fans, and relays. The electronics in the drive serve a critical role in maintaining proper motor control. Follow the inspection lists provided in this chapter as a part of a regular maintenance program. Note: The drive will require more frequent inspection if it is placed in harsh environments, such as: • High ambient temperatures • Frequent starting and stopping • Fluctuations in the AC supply or load • Excessive vibrations or shock loading • Dust, metal dust, salt, sulfuric acid, chlorine atmospheres • Poor storage conditions. Perform the first equipment inspection 3 months after installation. uRecommended Daily Inspection Table 7.1 outlines the recommended daily inspection for Yaskawa drives. Check the following items on a daily basis to avoid premature deterioration in performance or product failure. Copy this checklist and mark the “Checked” column after each inspection. WARNING! Electrical Shock Hazard. Do not connect or disconnect wiring while the power is on. Failure to comply can result in serious personal injury.

To use current input at terminal A2, set the DIP switch S1 to "I" (default setting) and set parameter H3-09 = “2” or “3” (4-20 mA or 0-20 mA). Set parameter H3-10 = “0” (frequency reference). Note: If Terminals A1 and A2 are both set for frequency reference (H3-02 = 0 and H3-10 = 0), the addition of both input values builds the frequency reference.

motor as soon as it gets ready for operation (i.e. once the internal start up process is complete). WARNING! Sudden Movement Hazard. If b1-17 is set to 1 and an external Run command is active during power up, the motor will begin rotating as soon as the power is switched on. Proper precautions must be taken to ensure that the area around the motor is safe prior to powering up the drive. Failure to comply may cause serious injury. ub2: DC Injection Braking These parameters determine how the DC Injection Braking/Short Circuit Braking feature operates. Parameters involving the starting frequency, current level, braking time are located here. nb2-01: DC Injection Braking Start Frequency Active when “Ramp to Stop” is selected as the stopping method (b1-03 = 0).

3-Wire sequence has been set for reverse. nMotor is Too Hot Cause Possible Solutions The load is too heavy.If the load is too heavy for the motor, the motor will overheat as it exceeds its rated torque value for an extended period of time. Keep in mind that the motor also has a short-term overload rating in addition to the possible solutions provided below: •Reduce the load. • Increase the acceleration and deceleration times. • Check the values set for the motor protection (L1-01, L1-02) as well as the motor rated current (E2-01). • Increase motor capacity. The air around the motor is too hot.• Check the ambient temperature. •Cool the area until it is within the specified temperature range. The drive is operating in a vector control mode but Auto-Tuning has not yet been performed.• Perform Auto-Tuning. •Calculate the motor value and reset the motor parameters. • Change the motor control method to V/f Control (A1-02 = “0”). Insufficient voltage insulation between motor phases.When the motor is connected to terminals U/T1, V/T2, and W/T3, voltage surges occur between the motor coils and drive switching. Normally, surges can reach up to three times the drive input power supply voltage (600 V for 200 V class, and 1200 V for 400 V class). • Use a motor with voltage tolerance higher than the max voltage surge. • Use a motor designed to work specifically with a drive when using a 400 V class unit. • Install an AC reactor on the output side of the drive. The motor fan has stopped or
designed for permanent magnet motors (A1-02 = 5), make sure that the proper motor code is set in parameter E5-01 before performing a trial run. nUpper Limits The drive is capable of running the motor up to 400 Hz. Due to the danger of accidentally operating the motor at high speed, be sure to set the upper frequency limit. The default setting for the maximum output frequency is 60 Hz. nDC Injection Braking Motor overheat can result if there is too much current used during DC Injection Braking, or if the DC Injection Braking time is too long. nAcceleration/Deceleration Times Acceleration and deceleration times are affected by how much torque the motor generates, the load torque, and the inertia moment ((GD2)/4). Set a longer accel/decel time when Stall Prevention is enabled. The accel/decel times are lengthened for as long as the Stall Prevention function is operating. For faster acceleration and deceleration, install a braking option or increase the capacity of the drive. uGeneral Handling NOTICE: Wiring Check. Never connect the power supply lines to output terminals U/T1, V/T2, or W/T3. Doing so will destroy the drive. Be sure to perform a final check of all control wiring and other connections before applying line power. Make sure there are no short circuits on the control terminals (+V, AC, etc.), as this could damage the drive. nSelecting a Molded Case Circuit Breaker (MCCB) or Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) Yaskawa recommends installing a GFCI on the line power
increases the motor losses and the motor temperature. If applied too long, motor damage can occur. Prevent excessive overexcitation operation or apply proper cooling to the motor • Reduce the excitation deceleration gain (n3-13). • Set L3-04 (Stall Prevention during Deceleration) to a value other than 4. Speed Search related parameters are not set to the proper values.• Check values set to Speed Search related parameters. • Adjust the Speed Search current and Speed Search deceleration times (b3-02 and b3-03 respectively). • After Auto-Tuning, enable Speed Estimation Type Search (b3-24 = “1”). Output current fluctuation due to input phase lossCheck the power supply for phase loss.

Reduce the load. Cycle times are too short during acceleration and deceleration.Increase the settings for the acceleration and deceleration times (C1-01 through C1-08). Voltage is too high for the V/f characteristics.• Adjust the preset V/f pattern (E1-04 through E1-10). This will mainly involve reducing E1-08 and E1-10. • Be careful not to lower E1-08 and E1-10 excessively because this reduces load tolerance at low speeds. Drive capacity is too small. Replace the drive with a larger model.

Electrical Shock Hazard. Ensure there are no short circuits between the main circuit terminals (R/L1, S/L2, and T/L3) or between the ground and main circuit terminals before restarting the drive. Failure to comply may result in serious injury or death and will cause damage to equipment. 1.Turn on the drive input power. 2.Use monitor parameters U2- oo to display data on the operating status of the drive just before the fault occurred. 3.Remove the cause of the fault and reset. Note: To find out what faults were triggered, check U2-02 (Fault History). Information on drive status when the fault occurred such as the frequency, current and voltage, can be found in U2-03 through U2-17. Refer to Viewing Fault Trace Data After Fault on page 298
power went out based on certain conditions. No. Name Setting Range Default L2-01 Momentary Power Loss Operation Selection 0 to 2 0 Setting 0: Disabled (default) If power is not restored within 15 ms, a Uv1 fault will result and the drive will stop the motor. Setting 1: Enabled, Recover Within L2-02 When a momentary power loss occurs, the drive will attempt to restart and perform Speed Search if power is restored within the period of time set to parameter L2-02. If power is not restored within the time set to L2-02 (i.e. DC bus voltage level remains below Uv1 detection level L2-05), then a Uv1 fault is triggered and the drive output will be shut off. Setting 2: Recover as Long as CPU has Power Drive will try to restart as long as the CPU still has power. This allows for a longer ride-through time than setting L2-01 to 1. A Uv1 fault is not triggered. This setting should also be used if the KEB function is utilized. Note: 1. The amount of time the drive is capable of recovering after a power loss is determined by the capacity of the drive. Drive capacity determines the upper limit for L2-02. 2.When L2-01 is set to 1 or 2, and a magnetic contactor between motor and drive is used, be sure that the magnetic contactor is kept close as long as the drive attempts to restart. 3.When L2-01 is set to 1 or 2, “Uv” will flash on the operator while the drive is attempting to recover from a momentary power loss.

range whenever using a standard blower cooled motor. If 100% torque is required continuously at low speed, consider using a special drive or vector motor. Select a motor that is compatible with the required load torque and operating speed range. Do not operate motors above the maximum rated RPM. Failure to comply may lead to bearing or other mechanical motor failures. The speed range for continuous operation differs according to the lubrication method and motor manufacturer. If the motor is to be operated at a speed higher than the rated speed, consult with the manufacturer. Continuously operating an oil-lubricated motor in the low-speed range may result in burning.2.1 Section Safety 36 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical ManualNOTICE When the wiring distance is greater than 100 meters, pay special attention to the motor insulation voltage or use a drive-rated motor. Failure to comply could lead to motor winding failure. Motor vibration may increase when operating a machine in variable-speed mode, if that machine previously operated at a constant speed. Install vibration-proof rubber on the motor base or use the frequency jump function to skip a frequency resonating the machine. The motor may require more acceleration torque with drive operation than with a commercial power supply. Set a proper V/f pattern by checking the load torque characteristics of the machine to be used with the motor. The rated input current of submersible motors is
speed. As the self-cooling capability of such a motor reduces with the speed, applying full torque at low speed will possibly damage the motor. To prevent motor damage from overheat, reduce the load torque as the motor slows. Figure i.4 shows the allowable load characteristics for a Yaskawa standard motor. A motor designed specifically for operation with a drive should be used when 100% continuous torque is needed at low speeds. 50 3 6 606070809010025% ED (or 15 min) 40% ED (or 20 min) 60% ED (or 40 min) Frequency (Hz)Continuous operationTorque (%) 20 Figure i.4 Allowable Load Characteristics for a Yaskawa Motor Insulation Tolerance Consider motor voltage tolerance levels and motor insulation in applications with an input voltage of over 440 V or particularly long wiring distances.

Contact the motor or machine manufacturer. Torque Characteristics Torque characteristics differ compared to operating the motor directly from line power. The user should have a full understanding of the load torque characteristics for the application. Vibration and Shock The drive settings allow the user to choose between high carrier PWM control and low carrier PWM. Selecting high carrier PWM
running multiple motors from the same drive, or if the motor is considerably smaller than the capacity of the drive. • Speed Estimation may have trouble finding the actual speed if the motor cable very long. Current Detection should be used in such situations. • Use Current Detection instead of Speed Estimation when operating motors smaller than 1.5 kW. Speed Estimation can end up stopping smaller motors as it might not be able to detect the speed or rotation direction of such small motors. • Use Short circuit Braking instead of Speed Estimation when using Open Loop Vector Control for PM motors along with a fairly long motor cable. • Use Short circuit Braking instead of Speed Estimation if attempting to find the speed of a motor coasting faster than 120 Hz in Open Loop Vector Control for PM motors. nCurrent Detection Type Speed Search (b3-24 = 0) Current Detection Speed Search can be applied to any motor. Be aware that sudden acceleration may occur when using Current Detection with relatively light loads. This method detects the motor speed by reducing the output frequency and measuring the current. The frequency reduction starts from the maximum output frequency or from the set frequency reference. As long as the output frequency is higher than the rotor speed, the slip will cause a high current. The closer the output frequency comes to the rotor speed, the lower the current draw will be. When the output current drops below the level as set in b3-02, the output frequency
when running at rated nameplate base frequency (check the motor specifications).Continuous operation at less than line power frequency with 100% load can trigger motor overload protection (oL1). A fault is output and the motor will coast to stop. Setting 2: Drive Dedicated Motor (constant torque, 1:10) Use this setting when operating a drive duty motor with a torque ratio of 1:10. This motor type is allowed to run with 100% load from 10% up to 100% speed.

(Up/Down 2) This parameter is used to save the frequency reference bias value set by the Up/Down 2 function. It is set as a percentage of the maximum output frequency. The function of d4-06 depends on how the Up/Down 2 function is configured. • This parameter is not normally used when the frequency reference is set by the digital operator. The user can set d4-06 to a certain value that will be applied when the operation is started, but it will be reset when the frequency reference changes (including multi-step references) or will be disabled when d4-01 = 0 and the Run command is removed. • When d4-01 = 0 and the frequency reference is set by an analog or pulse input, the value set in d4-06 is generally added to or subtracted from the frequency reference. • When d4-01 = 1 and the frequency reference is set by a different source than the digital operator, the bias value adjusted with the Up/Down 2 inputs is stored in d4-06 when 5 s have passed after the Up 2 or Down 2 command release.

Using the Up/Down Function with Frequency Reference Hold (d4-01) • When the frequency reference hold function is disabled (d4-01 = 0), the Up/Down frequency reference will be reset to 0 when the Run command is cleared or the power is cycled. • When d4-01 = 1, the drive will save the frequency reference set by the Up/Down function. When the Run command or the power is cycled, the drive will restart with the reference value that was saved. The value that was saved can be reset by closing either the Up or Down input without having a Run command active. Refer to d4-01: Frequency Reference Hold Function Selection on page 162. Using the Up/Down Function with Frequency Reference Limits The upper frequency reference limit is determined by parameter d2-01. The value for the lower frequency reference limit depends on the setting of parameter d4-10 and can be set by an analog input or parameter d2-02. Refer to d4-10: Up/Down Frequency Reference Limit Selection on page 167 for details. When a Run command is applied, the lower limits work as follows: • If the lower limit is set by parameter d2-02 only, the drive will accelerate to this limit as soon as a Run command is entered. • If the lower limit is determined by an analog input only, the drive will accelerate to the limit as long as the Run command and an Up or Down command are active. It will not start running if only the Run command is on. • If the lower limit is set by both an analog input and d2-02, and the analog limit is higher

Failure to comply will result in death or serious injury. WARNING Electrical Shock Hazard Do not operate equipment with covers removed. Failure to comply could result in death or serious injury. The diagrams in this section may illustrate drives without covers or safety shields to display details. Be sure to reinstall covers or shields before operating the drives and run the drives according to the instructions described in this manual. Always ground the motor-side grounding terminal. Improper equipment grounding could result in death or serious injury by contacting the motor case. Do not touch terminals before the capacitors have fully discharged. Failure to comply could result in death or serious injury. Before wiring terminals, disconnect all power to the equipment. The internal capacitor remains charged even after the drive input power is turned off. The charge indicator LED will extinguish when the DC bus voltage is below 50 Vdc. To prevent electric shock, wait at least five minutes after all indicators are off and measure the DC bus voltage level to confirm safe level. Do not allow unqualified personnel to perform work on the drive. Failure to comply could result in death or serious injury. Installation, maintenance, inspection and servicing must be performed only by authorized personnel familiar with installation, adjustment
with a built-in holding brake. If the brake is connected to the output side of the drive, it may not release at start due to low voltage levels. A separate power supply should be installed for the motor brake. Motors with a built-in brake tend to generate a fair amount of noise when running at low speeds. nPower Driven Machinery (decelerators, belts, chains, etc.) Continuous operation at low speeds wears on the lubricating material used in gear box type systems to accelerate and decelerate power driven machinery. Caution should also be taken when operating at speeds above the rated machine speed due to noise and shortened performance life.i.3 Application Precautions 22 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical ManualReceiving This chapter describes the proper inspections to perform after receiving the drive and illustrates the different enclosure types and components. 1.1 SECTION SAFETY ................................................................................................. 24 1.2 MODEL NUMBER AND NAMEPLATE CHECK .................................................... 25 1.3 DRIVE MODELS AND ENCLOSURE TYPES........................................................27 1.4 COMPONENT NAMES ........................................................................................... 281 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual 231.1 Section Safety CAUTION Do not carry the drive by the front cover.

This may be a result of improper stall prevention or automatic torque boost function adjustment.Increase the acceleration time (C1-01) or reduce the motor load. Also, consider increasing the motor size and/or drive size. nMotor Rotates in One Direction Only Cause Possible Solutions "Reverse run prohibited" is selected. If b1-04 (Reverse Prohibit Operation) is set to 1 (reverse run prohibited), the drive will not accept a reverse run command.Set b1-04 = “0” to allow reverse run operation. The drive prohibits reverse rotation.• Check parameter b1-04. •Set the drive to allow the motor to rotate in reverse (b1-04 = “0”). A Reverse run signal has not been entered, although 3- Wire sequence is selected.• Make sure that one of the input terminals S3 to S5 used for the 3-Wire sequence has been set for reverse.

more acceleration torque with drive operation than with a commercial power supply. Set a proper V/f pattern by checking the load torque characteristics of the machine to be used with the motor. The rated input current of submersible motors is higher than the rated input current of standard motors. Select an appropriate drive according to its rated output current. When the distance between the motor and drive is long, use a cable thick enough to connect the motor to the drive to prevent motor torque reduction. When using an explosion-proof motor, it must be subject to an explosion-proof test in conjunction with the drive. This is also applicable when an existing explosion-proof motor is to be operated with the drive. Since the drive itself is not explosion-proof, always install it in a safe place. Be sure to set A1-02 to “0” when using an explosion-proof motor. Do not use a drive for a single-phase motor. Replace the motor with a three-phase motor. If an oil-lubricated gearbox or speed reducer is used in the power transmission mechanism, oil lubrication will be affected when the motor operates only in the low speed range. The power transmission mechanism will make noise and experience problems with service life and durability if the motor is operated at a speed higher than the rated speed.2.1 Section Safety YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual 372Mechanical Installation2.2 Mechanical Installation This section outlines specifications,
Precautions YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual 21Explosion-Proof Motor Both the motor and drive need to be tested together to be certified as explosion-proof. The drive is not designed for explosion proof areas. Furthermore, if an encoder is attached to an explosion-proof motor make sure the encoder is also explosion-proof. Use an insulating signal converter for connecting the encoder signal lines to the drives speed feedback option card. Geared Motor To avoid gear damage when operating at low speeds or very high speeds, make sure that both the gear and lubricant are rated for the desired speed range. Consult with the manufacturer for applications that require operation outside the rated speed range of the motor or gear box. Single-Phase Motor Variable speed AC drives are not designed for operation with single phase motors. Using capacitors to start the motor causes excessive current to flow and can damage drive components. A split-phase start or a repulsion start can end up burning out the starter coils because the internal centrifugal switch is not activated. The drive is for use with 3-phase motors only. Motor with Brake Caution should be taken when using a drive to operate a motor with a built-in holding brake. If the brake is connected to the output side of the drive, it may not release at start due to low voltage levels. A separate power supply should be installed for the motor brake. Motors with a built-in brake tend to
or hoist type applications. • Restarting a Coasting Motor: To restart a coasting motor rotating at over 200 Hz while in the V/f control mode, use the Short Circuit Braking function to first bring the motor to a stop. Short Circuit Braking requires a special braking resistor. Contact Yaskawa or your Yaskawa agent for details. Speed Search can be used to restart a coasting motor rotating slower than 200 Hz. If the motor cable is relatively long, however, the motor should instead be stopped using Short Circuit Braking, which forces the motor to stop by creating a short-circuit in the motor windings. nApplications with Specialized Motors Multi-Pole Motor Because the rated current will differ from a standard motor, be sure to check the maximum current when selecting a drive. Always stop the motor before switching between the number of motor poles. If a regen overvoltage (oV) fault occurs or if overcurrent protection (oC) is triggered, the motor will coast to stop. Submersible Motor Because motor rated current is greater than a standard motor, select the drive capacity accordingly. Be sure to use a large enough gauge motor cable to avoid decreasing the maximum torque level on account of voltage drop caused by a long motor cable.i.3 Application Precautions YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual 21Explosion-Proof Motor Both the motor and drive need to be tested together to be certified as explosion-proof. The drive is not designed for explosion
range whenever using a standard blower cooled motor. If 100% torque is required continuously at low speed, consider using a special drive or vector motor. Select a motor that is compatible with the required load torque and operating speed range. Do not operate motors above the maximum rated RPM. Failure to comply may lead to bearing or other mechanical motor failures. The speed range for continuous operation differs according to the lubrication method and motor manufacturer. If the motor is to be operated at a speed higher than the rated speed, consult with the manufacturer. Continuously operating an oil-lubricated motor in the low-speed range may result in burning.2.1 Section Safety 36 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical ManualNOTICE When the wiring distance is greater than 100 meters, pay special attention to the motor insulation voltage or use a drive-rated motor. Failure to comply could lead to motor winding failure. Motor vibration may increase when operating a machine in variable-speed mode, if that machine previously operated at a constant speed. Install vibration-proof rubber on the motor base or use the frequency jump function to skip a frequency resonating the machine. The motor may require more acceleration torque with drive operation than with a commercial power supply. Set a proper V/f pattern by checking the load torque characteristics of the machine to be used with the motor. The rated input current of submersible motors is
