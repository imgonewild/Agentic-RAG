8.2. Exposure controls
8.2.1. Engineering controls
Do not remain in area where available oxygen may be reduced. Use general dilution ventilation and/or local exhaust 
ventilation to control airborne exposures to below relevant Exposure Limits and/or control dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray. 
If ventilation is not adequate, use respiratory protection equipment.
8.2.2. Personal protective equipment (PPE)
Eye/face protection
Select and use eye/face protection to prevent contact based on the results of an exposure assessment. The following eye/face 
protection(s) are recommended:
Indirect Vented Goggles
Skin/hand protection
Select and use gloves and/or protective clothing approved to relevant local standards to prevent skin contact based on the 
results of an exposure assessment. Selection should be based on use factors such as exposure levels, concentration of the 
substance or mixture, frequency and duration, physical challenges such as temperature extremes, and other use conditions. 
Consult with your glove and/or protective clothing manufacturer for selection of appropriate compatible gloves/protective 
clothing.
Gloves made from the following material(s) are recommended: Nitrile Rubber
Respiratory protection
An exposure assessment may be needed to decide if a respirator is required. If a respirator is needed, use respirators as part 
of a full respiratory protection program. Based on the results of the exposure assessment, select from the following 
respirator type(s) to reduce inhalation exposure:
Half facepiece or full facepiece supplied-air respirator
Organic vapor respirators may have short service life.
For questions about suitability for a specific application, consult with your respirator manufacturer.

available, waste product that has been completely cured or polymerized may be placed in a landfill properly designed for 
industrial waste. The facility should be equipped to handle gaseous waste. Empty drums/barrels/containers used for 
transporting and handling hazardous chemicals (chemical substances/mixtures/preparations classified as Hazardous as per 
applicable regulations) shall be considered, stored, treated & disposed of as hazardous wastes unless otherwise defined by 
applicable waste regulations. Consult with the respective regulating authorities to determine the available treatment and

National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) hazard ratings are designed for use by emergency response personnel to address 
the hazards that are presented by short-term, acute exposure to a material under conditions of fire, spill, or similar 
emergencies. Hazard ratings are primarily based on the inherent physical and toxic properties of the material but also include 
the toxic properties of combustion or decomposition products that are known to be generated in significant quantities.
