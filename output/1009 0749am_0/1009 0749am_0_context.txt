Failure to comply will result in death or serious injury. WARNING Electrical Shock Hazard Do not operate equipment with covers removed. Failure to comply could result in death or serious injury. The diagrams in this section may illustrate drives without covers or safety shields to display details. Be sure to reinstall covers or shields before operating the drives and run the drives according to the instructions described in this manual. Always ground the motor-side grounding terminal. Improper equipment grounding could result in death or serious injury by contacting the motor case. Do not touch terminals before the capacitors have fully discharged. Failure to comply could result
could result in drive or equipment malfunction or nuisance trips. NOTICE: Use a class 2 power supply (UL standard) when connecting to the control terminals. Improper application of peripheral devices could result in drive performance degradation due to improper power supply. NOTICE: Insulate shields with tape or shrink tubing to prevent contact with other signal lines and equipment. Improper wiring practices could result in drive or equipment malfunction due to short circuit. NOTICE: Connect the shield of shielded cable to the appropriate ground terminal. Improper equipment grounding could result in drive or equipment malfunction or nuisance trips. Wire the control terminals using Figure 3.20 as a guide. Prepare the ends of the control circuit wiring as shown in Figure 3.21. Refer to Wire Size and Torque Specifications on page 66.3.7 Control Circuit Wiring 66 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical ManualNOTICE: Do not tighten screws beyond the specified tightening torque. Failure to comply may damage the terminal block. NOTICE: Use shielded twisted-pair cables as indicated to prevent operating faults. Improper wiring practices could result in drive or equipment malfunction due to electrical interference. Connect control wires as shown in the following figure: Preparing wire terminal endsEA BD C A – Control terminal block B– Avoid fraying wire strands when stripping insulation from wire. Strip length 5.5 mm. C – Single wire or stranded wireD –
not connect phase-advancing capacitors or LC/RC noise filters to the output circuits. Improper application of noise filters could result in damage to the drive. NOTICE: Do not connect the AC power line to the output motor terminals of the drive. Failure to comply could result in death or serious injury by fire as a result of drive damage from line voltage application to output terminals. nCable Length Between Drive and Motor When the cable length between the drive and the motor is too long (especially at low frequency output), note that the cable voltage drop may cause reduced motor torque. Drive output current will increase as the leakage current from the cable increases. An increase in leakage current may trigger an overcurrent situation and weaken the accuracy of the current detection. Adjust the drive carrier frequency according to the following table. If the motor wiring distance exceeds 100 m because of the system configuration, reduce the ground currents. Refer to C6-02: Carrier Frequency Selection on page 156 Refer to Table 3.5 to set the carrier frequency to an appropriate level. Table 3.5 Cable Length Between Drive and Motor Cable Length 50 m or less 100 m or less Greater than 100 m Carrier Frequency 15 kHz or less 5 kHz or less 2 kHz or less Note: When setting carrier frequency, calculate the cable length as the total distance of wiring to all connected motors when running multiple motors from a single drive.3.6 Main Circuit Wiring YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606
The charge indicator LED will extinguish when the DC bus voltage is below 50 Vdc. CAUTION! Burn Hazard. Do not touch a hot drive heatsink. Failure to comply could result in minor or moderate injury. Shut off the power to the drive when replacing the cooling fan. To prevent burns, wait at least 15 minutes and make sure the heatsink has cooled to a safe level. WARNING! Electrical Shock Hazard. Wait for at least the time specified on the drive warning label after opening the load switch on the output side before any inspection or maintenance of permanent magnet (PM) motors. Failure to comply could result in death or serious injury. WARNING! Sudden Movement Hazard. Install a switch disconnect between the motor and the drive in applications where the machine can still rotate even though the drive has fully stopped. Unpredictable equipment operation may result in death or serious injury. WARNING! Sudden Movement Hazard. Do not attempt to move a load that could potentially rotate the motor faster than the maximum allowable r/min when the drive has been shut off. Unpredictable equipment operation may result in death or serious injury. NOTICE: Do not open and close the motor disconnect switch while the motor is running, as this may damage the drive. NOTICE: If the motor is coasting, make sure the power to the drive is turned on and the drive output has completely stopped before closing the load switch. nWiring All wire ends should use ring terminals for UL/cUL compliance. Use only

proper direction. • The motor should accelerate and decelerate smoothly. nOperating the Motor under Loaded Conditions Test run the application similarly to the no-load test procedure when connecting the machinery to the motor. • Check monitor parameter U1-03 to ensure there is no overcurrent. • If the application permits running the load in the reverse direction, try changing motor direction and the frequency reference while watching for abnormal motor oscillation or vibration. • Correct any problems that occurs with hunting, oscillation, or other control-related issues.4.9 Test Run with Load Connected YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual 1094Start-Up Programming & Operation4.10 Verifying Parameter Settings and Backing Up Changes Check changes to parameter settings as a result of Auto-Tuning using the Verify function. Refer to Verifying Parameter Changes: Verify Menu on page 88. Save the verified parameter settings. Change the access level or set a password to the drive to prevent accidental modification of parameter settings. uBacking Up Parameter Values: o2-03 Performing the following procedure stores all parameters settings to drive memory where they can later be recalled if necessary. Set o2-03 to “1” to save parameter changes. This saves all parameter settings, and then returns o2-03 to 0. The drive can now “recall” the saved parameters by performing a “user-initialization” (A1-03 = 1110). No. Parameter Name DescriptionSetting

too high or acceleration and deceleration times are too short, the motor may be unable to keep up with the frequency reference, resulting in excessive slip. This “stalling” makes it impossible to decelerate or accelerate. The drive can prevent the motor from stalling and still reach the desired speed without the user needing to change the acceleration or deceleration time settings. The Stall Prevention function can be set separately for acceleration, operating at constant speeds, and deceleration. nL3-01: Stall Prevention Selection during Acceleration Stall Prevention during acceleration is used when the motor loses speed during acceleration due to a relatively large load. It prevents overcurrent and motor overload (oL1) from occurring. This parameter sets the Stall Prevention method for acceleration. No. Name Setting Range Default L3-01 Stall Prevention Selection during Acceleration 0 to 2 <1> 1 <1> Setting 2 is not available for PM OLV. Setting 0: Disabled No Stall Prevention is provided. If the acceleration time setting is too short, the drive may not be able to accelerate within the set time and the motor may stall. Setting 1: Enabled Enables Stall Prevention during acceleration. The operation depends on the selected control mode. • V/f or Open Loop Vector Control: When the output current exceeds 85% of the level set in parameter L3-02, the acceleration rate is reduced. The acceleration is stopped when the current exceeds L3-02. Acceleration continues when the current
Occurs When Running at a Constant Speed Cause Possible Solutions Excessive load inertia in Open Loop Vector Control.• Loads with a lot of inertia (fans, etc.) can trigger an overvoltage fault when operating in Open Loop Vector Control. • Switch to the V/f motor control method. • Adjust the values set for the speed feedback detection control time constant (n2-02, n2-03). nMotor Stalls During Acceleration or With Large Loads Cause Possible Solutions Load is too heavy.Take the following steps to resolve the problem: •Reduce the load. • Increase the acceleration time. • Increase motor capacity. • Although the drive has a Stall Prevention function and a Torque Compensation Limit function, accelerating too quickly or trying to drive an excessively large load can exceed the capabilities of the motor. nMotor Will Not Accelerate or the Acceleration Time is Too Long Cause Possible Solutions Frequency reference is too low.• Check the maximum output frequency (E1-04). •Increase E1-04 if it is set too low. Check U1-01 for proper frequency reference. Check if a frequency reference signal switch has been set to one of the multi-function input terminals. Check for low gain level set to terminals A1 or A2 (H3-03, H3-11). Load is too heavy.• Reduce the load so that the output current remains within the motor-rated current. • In extruder and mixer applications, the load will sometimes increase as the temperature drops. Check if the mechanical brake is fully releasing as it should. The torque

Note: When operation permits, use normal Overexcitation Deceleration (L3-04 = 4). nL3-05: Stall Prevention Selection During Run Stall Prevention During Run can prevent a motor from stalling by automatically reducing the speed when a transient overload occurs while the motor is running at constant speed. This parameter selects the Stall Prevention During Run method. No. Name Setting Range Default L3-05 Stall Prevention Selection During Run 0 to 2 1 Note: 1. This function is not available in Open Loop Vector Control. Use the torque limit function instead. 2.When output frequency is 6 Hz or less, Stall Prevention During Run is disabled regardless of the setting in L3-05/06.5.8 L: Protection Functions 224 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical ManualSetting 0: Disabled Drive runs at the set frequency reference. A heavy load may cause the motor to stall and trip the drive with an oC or oL fault. Setting 1: Decelerate Using C1-02 If the current exceeds the Stall Prevention level set in parameter L3-06, the drive decelerates at Decel Time 1 (C1-02). Once the current level drops below the value of L3-06 minus 2% for 100 ms it accelerates back to the frequency reference at the active acceleration time. Setting 2: Decelerate Using C1-04 Same as setting 1 except the drive decelerates at decel time 2 (C1-04). nL3-06: Stall Prevention Level During Run Sets the current level
to stop while in Open Loop Vector Control. Cause Possible Solution Motor parameters are not set properly. Check the motor parameter settings and repeat Auto-Tuning. Torque limit is too low. Set the torque limit to the most appropriate setting (L7-01 through L7-04). Load inertia is too big.• Adjust the deceleration time (C1-02, -04, -06, -08). •Set the frequency to the minimum value and interrupt the run command when the drive finishes decelerating.

Selecting one of these Application Presets automatically sets the required parameters to the Application Preset default values and selects I/Os. In addition, the parameters most likely to be changed are assigned to the list of User Parameters, A2-01 through A2-16. These can be accessed in the Setup Mode and provide quicker application adjustment by eliminating the need to scroll through multiple menus. The following presets can be selected: Note: 1.Do not set any value outside the allowable range for A1-06. Setting an out-of-range value will cause “APPL” to flash on the display in the Setup group and disable the up and down arrow keys on the digital operator. To fix this error, press the ESC key to return to the Setup group and then it will then be possible to switch to another mode using the up and down arrow keys. 2.A1-06 setting can only be changed by initializing the drive by first setting A1-03 to 2220. Setting A1-06 to a value that is out of range will not adversely affect drive operation. When the drive should not be initialized because initialization will cause other problems, then A1-06 does not need to be changed.

situations. • Use Current Detection instead of Speed Estimation when operating motors smaller than 1.5 kW. Speed Estimation can end up stopping smaller motors as it might not be able to detect the speed or rotation direction of such small motors. • Use Short circuit Braking instead of Speed Estimation when using Open Loop Vector Control for PM motors along with a fairly long motor cable. • Use Short circuit Braking instead of Speed Estimation if attempting to find the speed of a motor coasting faster than 120 Hz in Open Loop Vector Control for PM motors. nCurrent Detection Type Speed Search (b3-24 = 0) Current Detection Speed Search can be applied to any motor. Be aware that sudden acceleration may occur when using Current Detection with relatively light loads. This method detects the motor speed by reducing the output frequency and measuring the current. The frequency reduction starts from the maximum output frequency or from the set frequency reference. As long as the output frequency is higher than the rotor speed, the slip will cause a high current. The closer the output frequency comes to the rotor speed, the lower the current draw will be. When the output current drops below the level as set in b3-02, the output frequency stops decreasing and normal operation resumes. The following time chart illustrates how Current Detection Speed Search operates after a momentary power loss:5.2 b: Application YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual

The acceleration or deceleration times are too short.Calculate the torque needed during acceleration relative to the load inertia and the specified acceleration time. If the right amount of torque cannot be set, make the following changes: • Increase the acceleration time (C1-01, C1-03, C1-05, C1-07) • Increase the S-curve characteristics (C2-01 through C2-04) • Increase the capacity of the drive. The drive is attempting to operate a specialized motor or a motor larger than the maximum size allowed.• Check the motor capacity. • Ensure that the rated capacity of the drive is greater than or equal to the capacity rating found on the motor nameplate. Magnetic contactor (MC) on the output side of the drive has turned on or off.Set up the operation sequence so that the MC is not tripped while the drive is outputting current.

air circulation around the heatsink. This installation method still requires a certain amount of airflow over the drive case. Refer to Output Current Derating Due to Ambient Temperature on page 351 if derating is required. Contact a Yaskawa sales representative for more information. uNoise Filter Installation This drive has undergone testing in conformance with IEC/EN 61800-5-1 and is in compliance with low voltage directives. Refer to EMC Guidelines Compliance on page 469 for information on selecting a noise filter. uInstalling a Motor Thermal Overload (oL) Relay on the Drive Output Motor thermal overload relays protect the motor by disconnecting power lines to the motor due to a motor overload condition. Install a motor thermal overload relay between the drive and motor: • When operating multiple motors on a single AC drive. • When using a power line bypass to operate the motor directly from the power line. It is not necessary to install a motor thermal overload relay when operating a single motor from a single AC drive. The AC drive has UL recognized electronic motor overload protection built into the drive software. Note: Disable the motor protection function (L1-0 1 = “0”) when using an external motor thermal overload relay. The relay should shut off main power on the input side of the main circuit when triggered. nGeneral Precautions when Using Thermal Overload Relays The following application precautions should be considered when using motor thermal overload relays on
Relays Generally, thermal relays are applied on general-purpose motors. When general-purpose motors are driven by AC drives, the motor current is approximately 5 to 10% greater than if driven by the commercial power supply. In addition, the cooling capacity of a motor with a shaft-driven fan decreases when operating at low speeds. Even if the load current is within the motor rated value, motor overheating may occur. A thermal relay cannot effectively protect the motor due to the reduction of cooling at low speeds. For this reason, apply the UL recognized electronic thermal overload protection function built into the drive whenever possible. UL recognized electronic thermal overload function of the drive: Speed-dependent heat characteristics are simulated using data from standard motors and force-ventilated motors. The motor is protected from overload using this function. Using One Drive with Multiple Motors Turn off the electronic thermal overload function. Please refer to the appropriate product instruction manual to determine which parameter disables this function. The UL recognized electronic thermal overload function of the drive cannot be applied when using multiple motors on one drive. Long Motor Cables When long motor cables and high carrier frequency are used, nuisance tripping of the thermal relay may occur due to increased leakage current. Therefore, reduce the carrier frequency or increase the tripping level of the thermal overload relay. Nuisance Tripping
Drive with Multiple Motors Turn off the electronic thermal overload function. Please refer to the appropriate product instruction manual to determine which parameter disables this function. The UL recognized electronic thermal overload function of the drive cannot be applied when using multiple motors on one drive. Long Motor Cables When long motor cables and high carrier frequency are used, nuisance tripping of the thermal relay may occur due to increased leakage current. Therefore, reduce the carrier frequency or increase the tripping level of the thermal overload relay. Nuisance Tripping Resulting from High AC Drive Carrier Frequency Current waveforms generated by high carrier frequency PWM drives tend to create additional temperature rise in overload relays. Therefore, it may be necessary to increase the trip level setting when encountering nuisance triggering of the relay.8.4 Installing Peripheral Devices YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual 3358Peripheral Devices & OptionsWARNING! Fire Hazard. Confirm an actual motor overload condition is not present prior to increasing the thermal oL trip setting. Check local electrical codes before making adjustments to motor thermal overload settings.8.4 Installing Peripheral Devices 336 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical Manual8.5 Communication Options Table 8.2 gives detailed information about the available options that allow Yaskawa drives to connect to
from the power line. It is not necessary to install a motor thermal overload relay when operating a single motor from a single AC drive. The AC drive has UL recognized electronic motor overload protection built into the drive software. Note: Disable the motor protection function (L1-0 1 = “0”) when using an external motor thermal overload relay. The relay should shut off main power on the input side of the main circuit when triggered. nGeneral Precautions when Using Thermal Overload Relays The following application precautions should be considered when using motor thermal overload relays on the output of AC drives in order to prevent nuisance trips or overheat of the motor at low speeds: • Low speed motor operation • Use of multiple motors on a single AC drive • Motor cable length • Nuisance tripping resulting from high AC drive carrier frequency Low Speed Operation and Motor Thermal oL Relays Generally, thermal relays are applied on general-purpose motors. When general-purpose motors are driven by AC drives, the motor current is approximately 5 to 10% greater than if driven by the commercial power supply. In addition, the cooling capacity of a motor with a shaft-driven fan decreases when operating at low speeds. Even if the load current is within the motor rated value, motor overheating may occur. A thermal relay cannot effectively protect the motor due to the reduction of cooling at low speeds. For this reason, apply the UL recognized electronic thermal overload protection

Parameters To save specific parameters to A2-01 to A2-32, first set the access level to allow access to all parameters (A1-02 = 2). Next assign the parameter number to the User Parameters list by entering it into one of the A2- oo parameters. By then setting A1-01 to “1”, the access level can be restricted so that users can only set and reference the specific parameters saved as User Parameters. nA2-33: User Parameter Automatic Selection A2-33 determines whether or not parameters that have been edited are saved to the User Parameters (A2-17 to A2-32) for quick, easy access.

Output Frequency Deceleration characteristics when Stall Prevention was triggered during deceleration Time specified deceleration time Figure 5.84 Stall Prevention During Deceleration Setting 2: Intelligent Stall Prevention With this setting the drive adjusts the deceleration rate so that the DC bus voltage is kept at the level set in parameter L3-17. This way the shortest possible deceleration time is achieved while the motor is protected from stalling. The deceleration time that has been selected is disregarded, but the achievable deceleration time cannot be smaller than 1/10 of the set deceleration time. This function uses the following parameters for adjusting the deceleration rate: • DC bus voltage gain L3-20 • Deceleration rate calculations gain L3-21 • Inertia calculations for motor acceleration time L3-24 • Load inertia ratio L3-25 Refer to these parameter descriptions for details. Note: As the deceleration time is not constant, Intelligent Stall Prevention should not be used in applications where stopping accuracy is a concern.
(L3-04 = 4) by increasing the amount of overexcitation current applied to the motor. Note: When operation permits, use normal Overexcitation Deceleration (L3-04 = 4). nL3-05: Stall Prevention Selection During Run Stall Prevention During Run can prevent a motor from stalling by automatically reducing the speed when a transient overload occurs while the motor is running at constant speed. This parameter selects the Stall Prevention During Run method. No. Name Setting Range Default L3-05 Stall Prevention Selection During Run 0 to 2 1 Note: 1. This function is not available in Open Loop Vector Control. Use the torque limit function instead. 2.When output frequency is 6 Hz or less, Stall Prevention During Run is disabled regardless of the setting in L3-05/06.5.8 L: Protection Functions 224 YASKAWA ELECTRIC SIEP C710606 18F YASKAWA AC Drive – V1000 Technical ManualSetting 0: Disabled Drive runs at the set frequency reference. A heavy load may cause the motor to stall and trip the drive with an oC or oL fault. Setting 1: Decelerate Using C1-02 If the current exceeds the Stall Prevention level set in parameter L3-06, the drive decelerates at Decel Time 1 (C1-02). Once the current level drops below the value of L3-06 minus 2% for 100 ms it accelerates back to the frequency reference at the active acceleration time. Setting 2: Decelerate Using C1-04 Same as setting 1 except the drive decelerates at decel time 2 (C1-04). nL3-06: Stall Prevention Level During Run Sets the current level
too high or acceleration and deceleration times are too short, the motor may be unable to keep up with the frequency reference, resulting in excessive slip. This “stalling” makes it impossible to decelerate or accelerate. The drive can prevent the motor from stalling and still reach the desired speed without the user needing to change the acceleration or deceleration time settings. The Stall Prevention function can be set separately for acceleration, operating at constant speeds, and deceleration. nL3-01: Stall Prevention Selection during Acceleration Stall Prevention during acceleration is used when the motor loses speed during acceleration due to a relatively large load. It prevents overcurrent and motor overload (oL1) from occurring. This parameter sets the Stall Prevention method for acceleration. No. Name Setting Range Default L3-01 Stall Prevention Selection during Acceleration 0 to 2 <1> 1 <1> Setting 2 is not available for PM OLV. Setting 0: Disabled No Stall Prevention is provided. If the acceleration time setting is too short, the drive may not be able to accelerate within the set time and the motor may stall. Setting 1: Enabled Enables Stall Prevention during acceleration. The operation depends on the selected control mode. • V/f or Open Loop Vector Control: When the output current exceeds 85% of the level set in parameter L3-02, the acceleration rate is reduced. The acceleration is stopped when the current exceeds L3-02. Acceleration continues when the current
another L3-04 selection. Note: Use this setting or set L3-04 to 3 whenever a Dynamic Braking Resistor or another braking option is used. Setting 1: General Purpose Stall Prevention With this setting the drive tries to decelerate in the set deceleration time. When the DC bus voltage exceeds the Stall Prevention level, the drive pauses deceleration. Deceleration continues as soon as the DC bus voltage drops below that level. Stall Prevention may be triggered repeatedly to avoid an overvoltage fault. The DC bus voltage level for Stall Prevention depends on the input voltage setting E1-01. Drive Input Voltage Stall Prevention Level during Deceleration 200 V Class Vdc = 380 V 400 V ClassE1-01 ≥ 400 V Vdc = 760 V E1-01 < 400 V Vdc = 660 V Note: 1.
