WARNING Do not operate equipment with covers removed. Failure to comply could result in death or serious injury. Do not perform work on the drive while wearing loose clothing, jewelry or without eye protection. Failure to comply could result in death or serious injury. Remove all metal objects such as watches and rings, secure loose clothing and wear eye protection before beginning work on the drive. Do not remove covers or touch circuit boards while the power is on. Failure to comply could result in death or serious injury. Do not allow unqualified personnel to use equipment. Failure to comply could result in death or serious injury. Maintenance, inspection and replacement of parts must be performed only by authorized personnel familiar with installation, adjustment and maintenance of AC drives. Before wiring terminals, disconnect all power to the equipment. The internal capacitor remains charged even after the power supply is turned off. The charge indicator LED will extinguish when the DC bus voltage is below 50 Vdc. To prevent electric shock, wait at least one minute after all indicators are OFF and measure the DC bus voltage level to confirm safe level. Fire Hazard Tighten all terminal screws to the specified tightening torque. Loose electrical connections could result in death or serious injury by fire due to overheating of electrical connections.
