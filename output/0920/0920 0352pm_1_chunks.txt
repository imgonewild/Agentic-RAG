HEALTH HAZARDS OR RI SKS FROM EXPOSURE : 
ACUTE : 
INHALATION: Breathing high concentrations may be harmful. 
May cause central nervous system depression or effects. Symptoms may include headache, excitation, euphoria, 
dizziness, incoordination, drowsiness, light -headedness, blurred vision, fatigue, tremors, convulsions, loss of 
consciousness, coma, respiratory arrest and death, depending on the concentration and duration of exposure. 
Breathing high concentrations of this material, for example, in a confined space or by intentional abuse, can cause 
irregular heartbeats whi ch can cause death. 
EYE CONTACT: Contact may cause pain and severe reddening and inflammation of the conjunctiva. 
Effects may become more serious with repeated or prolonged contact. 
SKIN CONTACT: Contact may cause reddening, itching and inflammation. 
Skin contact may cause harmful effects in other parts of the body. 
INGESTION: Swallowing this material may be harmful. 
May cause irritation of the mouth, throat and gastrointestinal tract. 
May cause central nervous system depression or effects. Symptoms may include salivation, pain, nausea, vomiting 
and diarrhea. Exposure may also cause central nervous system symptoms similar to those listed under "Inhalation". 
CHRONIC : The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has determined that there 
is inade quate evidence for the carcinogenicity of gasoline in humans. IARC 
determined that limited evidence of carcinogenicity in animals exists. IARC`s overall 
evaluation of gasoline, in spite of limited carcinogenicity evidence, has resulted in the 
IARC designat ion of gasoline as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) 
because gasoline contains benzene.

REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY INFORMATION : This product is not reported to cause reproductive effects. 
OTHER INFORMATION ON COMPONENTS : 
BENZENE: Studies of Workers Overexposed to Benzene: Studies of wor kers exposed to benzene show clear evidence 
that overexposure can cause cancer andother diseases of the blood forming organs including Acute Myelogenous 
Leukemia (AML), and Aplastic Anemia (AA), an often fatal disease. Some studies suggest overexposure to benzene 
may also be associated with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Findings from a Case -Control study of workers exposed 
to benzene was reported during the 2009 Benzene Symposium in Munich included an increase in Acute Myeloid 
Leukemias and Non -Hodgkins L ymphoid Neoplasms (NHLN) of the subtype follicular lymphoma (FL) in some 
occupational categories. Some studies of workers exposed to benzene have shown an association with increased rates 
of chromosome aberrations in circulating lymphocytes. One study of w omen workers exposed to benzene suggested a 
weak association with irregular menstruation. However, other studies of workers exposed to benzene have not 
demonstrated clearevidence of an effect on fertility or reproductive outcome in humans. Benzene can cros s the placenta 
and affect the developing fetus. Cases of AA have been reported in the offspring of persons severely overexposed to 
benzene. Studies in laboratory animals indicate that prolonged, repeated exposure to high levels of benzene vapor can 
cause b one marrow suppression and cancer in multiple organ systems. Studies in laboratory animals show evidence of 
adverse effects on male reproductive organs following high levels of exposure but no significant effects on reproduction 
have been observed. Embryot oxicity has been reported in studies of laboratory animals but effects were limited to 
reduced fetal weight and minor skeletal variations. Benzene has been classified as a proven human carcinogen by 
OSHA and a Group 1 (Carcinogenic to Humans) material by I ARC. The current proposed IARC classification for 
benzene is summarized as follows: Sufficient evidence for Acute Myeloid Leukemia; limited evidence for Acute 
Lymphatic Leukemia, Chronic Lymphatic Leukemia, Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma, and Multiple Myeloma. 
NAPHT HAS: In a large epidemiological study on over 15,000 employees at several petroleum refineries and amongst 
residents located near these refineries, no increased risk of kidney cancer was observed in association with gasoline 
exposures (a similar material). In a similar study, no increased risk of kidney cancer was observed among petroleum 
refinery workers, but there was a slight trend in the incidence of kidney cancers among service station employees, 
especially after a 30 - year latency period. 
ISOPARAFFINS : Studies in laboratory animals have shown that long -term exposure to similar materials (isoparaffins) 
can cause kidney damage and kidney cancer in male laboratory rats. However, in -depth research indicates that these 
findings are unique to the male rat, a nd that these effects are not relevant to humans. 
TOLUENE: Case studies of persons abusing toluene suggest isolated incidences of adverse effects on the fetus 
including birth defects. Abuse of toluene at high concentrations (e.g., glue sniffing and solvent abuse) has been 
associated with adverse effects on the liver, kidney and nervous system, and can cause CNS depression, cardiac 
arrhythmias, and death. Studies of workers indicate longterm exposure may be related to impaired color vision and 
hearing. Some studies of workers suggest longterm exposure may be related to neurobehavioral and cognitive 
changes. Some of these effects have been observed in laboratory animals following repeated exposure to high levels of 
toluene. Several studies of workers suggest l ongterm exposure may be related to small increases in spontaneous 
abortions and changes in some gonadotropic hormones. However, the weight of evidence does not indicate toluene is a 
reproductive hazard to humans. Studies in laboratory animals indicate some changes in reproductive organs following 
high levels of exposure, but no significant effects on mating performance or reproduction were observed. Case studies 
of persons abusing toluene suggest isolated incidences of adverse effects on the fetus including birth defects. Findings 
in laboratory animals have been largely negative. Positive findings include small increases in minor skeletal and visceral 
malformations and developmental delays following very high levels of maternal exposure. Studies of workers i ndicate 
long-term exposure may be related to effects on the liver, kidney and blood, but these appear to be limited to changes in 
serum enzymes and decreased leukocyte counts. Adverse effects on the liver, kidney, thymus and nervous system were 
observed in animal studies following very high levels of exposure. The relevance of these findings to humans is not clear 
at this time. 
ETHYLBENZENE: Findings from a 2 -year inhalation study in rodents conducted by NTP were as follows: Effects were 
observed only at th e highest exposure level (750 ppm). At this level the incidence of renal tumors was elevated in male 
rats (tubular carcinomas) and female rats (tubular adenomas). The incidence of tumors was also elevated in male mice 
(alveolar and bronchiolar carcinomas) and female mice (hepatocellular carcinomas). IARC has classified ethyl benzene 
as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" (Group 2B). Studies in laboratory animals indicate some evidence of post 
implantation deaths following high levels of maternal exposure. The relevance of these findings to humans is not clear at 
this time. Studies in laboratory animals indicate limited evidence of renal malformations, resorptions, and developmental 
delays following high levels of maternal exposure. The relevance of these findi ngs to humans is not clear at this time. 
Studies in laboratory animals have demonstrated evidence of ototoxicity (hearing loss) following exposure levels as low

 as 300 ppm for 5 days. Studies in laboratory animals indicate some evidence of adverse effects on the liver, kidney, 
thyroid, and pituitary gland. 
XYLENES, ALL ISOMERS: Overexposure to xylene may cause upper respiratory tract irritation, headache, cyanosis, 
blood serum changes, CNS damage and narcosis. Effects may be increased by the use of alcoholi c beverages. 
Evidence of liver and kidney impairment were reported in workers recovering from a gross overexposure. Effects from 
Prolonged or Repeated Exposure: Impaired neurological function was reported in workers exposed to solvents including 
xylene. St udies in laboratory animals have shown evidence of impaired hearing following high levels of exposure. 
Studies in laboratory animals suggest some changes in reproductive organs following high levels of exposure but no 
significant effects on reproduction we re observed. Studies in laboratory animals indicate skeletal and visceral 
malformations, developmental delays, and increased fetal resorptions following extremely high levels of maternal 
exposure. The relevance of these observations to humans is not clear at this time. Adverse effects on the liver, kidney, 
bone marrow (changes in blood cell parameters) were observed in laboratory animals following high levels of exposure. 
The relevance of these observations to humans is not clear at this time. 
C9 AROMATIC H YDROCARBONS: A developmental inhalation study was conducted in laboratory mice. Increased 
implantation losses, reduced fetal weights, delayed ossification and an increased incidence of cleft palate were 
observed at the highest exposure level (1,500 ppm). T his exposure level was extremely toxic to pregnant female mice 
(44% mortality). Reduced fetal body weights were also observed at 500 ppm. A multi -generation reproduction inhalation 
study was conducted in laboratory rats. Reductions in pup weights, pup weig ht gain, litter size, and pup survival were 
observed at 1,500 ppm, an exposure level at which significant maternal toxicity was observed. Reduced pup weight gain 
was also observed at 500 ppm. 
NAPHTHALENE: Severe jaundice, neurotoxicity (kernicterus) and fa talities have been reported in young children and 
infants as a result of hemolytic anemia from overexposure to naphthalene. Persons with Glucose 6 -phosphate 
dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are more prone to the hemolytic effects of naphthalene. Adverse eff ects on the 
kidney have been reported in persons overexposed to naphthalene but these effects are believed to be a consequence 
of hemolytic anemia, and not a direct effect. Hemolytic anemia has been observed in laboratory animals exposed to 
studies) develo ped non -neoplastic and neoplastic tumors and inflammatory lesions of the nasal and respiratory tract. 
Cataracts and other adverse effects on the eye have been observed in laboratory animals exposed to high levels of 
naphthalene. Findings from a large numbe r of bacterial and mammalian cell mutation assays have been negative. A few 
studies have shown chromosomal effects (elevated levels of Sister Chromatid Exchange or chromosomal aberrations) 
in vitro. Naphthalene has been classified as Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans (2B) by IARC, based on findings from 
studies in laboratory animals. 
N-HEXANE: Long -term or repeated exposure to n -hexane can cause peripheral nerve damage. Initial symptoms are 
numbness of the fingers and toes. Also, motor weakness can occur in t he digits, but may also involve muscles of the 
arms, thighs and forearms. The onset of these symptoms may be delayed for several months to a year after the 
beginning of exposure. Testicular atrophy and partial to full loss of the germ cell line were observ ed in sub -chronic high -
dose inhalation studies of laboratory rodents. These effects appeared irreversible. Rodent reproduction studies have 
shown evidence of reduced fetal weight but no frank malformations. 
PENTANES: Studies of pentane isomers in laborator y animals indicate exposure to extremely high levels (roughly 10 
vol.%) may induce cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) which may be serious or fatal.
