8,What precautions should be taken while handling the product?,"When handling the product, it is recommended to wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as safety glasses, gloves, and a face shield. Additionally, proper ventilation should be maintained, especially in cases where vapors or mist are generated. In case of skin contact, hands should be washed thoroughly with soap and water. If handling hot product, heat-resistant and insulated gloves should be used. For respiratory protection, NIOSH-approved respirators may be necessary if concentrations exceed occupational exposure limits. Appropriate footwear should also be worn to prevent product from coming into contact with feet and skin. In case of a spill or leak, the area should be ventilated, and the product should be diluted with water and mopped up or absorbed with an inert material before being disposed of properly.","Section VII.
