VENTILATION: Provide general or local exhaust ventil ation systems to maintain airborne concentrations below OSHA PELs. Local exhaust ventilation is preferred because it prevents contaminant dispersion into the work place by controlling it at its source. RESPIRATORY PROTECTION: Seek professional advice prior to respirator selection and use. Follow OSHA respirator regulations (29 CFR 1910.134) and, if necessary, wear a MSHA / NIOSH approved respirator. Select respirator based on its suitability to provide adequate worker protection for given working conditions, level of airborne cont amination, and presence of sufficient oxygen. For emergency or non-routine operations (e.g. cleaning spi lls, reactor vessels, or st orage tanks), wear an SCBA. Warning! Air purifying respirators do not protect wor kers in oxygen-deficient atmospheres. If respirators are used, OSHA requires a written respir atory protection program th at includes at least: medical certification, training, fit te sting, periodic environmental m onitoring, maintenance, inspection, cleaning, and convenient, sanitary storage areas.
