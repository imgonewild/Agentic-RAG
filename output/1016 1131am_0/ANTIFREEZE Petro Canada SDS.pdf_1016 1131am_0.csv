23,What are the safety precautions and handling instructions for using the product?,"To use this product safely, follow these precautions and handling instructions: Wear appropriate clothing to prevent skin contact (long sleeves and trousers as a minimum). Avoid contamination with reactive substances. After handling, always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. Keep container dry. Keep container tightly closed. Keep in a cool, well-ventilated place. If user's operations generate vapors or mist, use ventilation to keep exposure to airborne contaminants below the exposure limit. Make-up air should always be supplied to balance air removed by exhaust ventilation. Ensure that eyewash station and safety shower are close to work-station. Wear appropriate chemically protective gloves when handling hot product, ensuring gloves are heat resistant and insulated. Wear appropriate footwear to prevent product from coming in contact with feet and skin. Use respiratory protection (NIOSH-approved respirators) where concentrations in air may exceed occupational exposure limits, and engineering, work practices, or other means of exposure reduction are not adequate.","Section VII.
