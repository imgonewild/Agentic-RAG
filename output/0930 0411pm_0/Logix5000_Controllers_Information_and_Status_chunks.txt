Safety Guidelines for the Application, Installation and Maintenance of Solid State Controls (publication SGI-1.1 available from your local Rockwell Automation sales office or online at http://www.rockwellautomation.com/literature/ ) describes some important differences between solid-state equipment and hard-wired electromechanical devices. Because of this difference, and also because of the wide variety of uses for solid-state equipment, all persons responsible for applying this equipment must satisfy themselves that each intended application of this equipment is acceptable. In no event will Rockwell Automation, Inc. be responsible or liable for indirect or consequential damages resulting from the use or application of this equipment. The examples and diagrams in this manual are included solely for illustrative purposes. Because of the many variables and requirements associated with any particular installation, Rockwell Automation, Inc. cannot assume responsibility or liability for actual use based on the examples and diagrams.

Term Definition Connection A communication link between two devices, such as between a controller and an I/O module, PanelView terminal, or another controller. Connections are allocations of resources that provide more reliable communication between devices than unconnected messages. The number of connections that a single controller can have is limited. You indirectly determine the number of connections the controller uses by conf iguring the controller to communicate with other devices in the system. These communication types use connections:•I/O modules •Produced and consumed tags •Certain types of Message (MSG) instruct ions (not all types use a connection) Requested packet interval (RPI)The RPI specifies the period at which data updates over a connection. For example, an input module sends data to a controller at the RPI that you assign to the module. •Typically, you configure an RPI in milliseconds (ms). The range is 0.2 ms (200 microseconds)…750 ms. •If a ControlNet network connects the devices, the RPI reserves a slot in the stream of data flowing across the ControlNet network. The timing of this slot may not coinci de with the exact value of the RPI, but the control system guarantees that the data transfers at least as

The timing of this slot may not coinci de with the exact value of the RPI, but the control system guarantees that the data transfers at least as often as the RPI. Path The path describes the route that a conn ection takes to get to the destination. Typically, you automatically define the path for a connection when you add the devices to the I/O Configuration folder of the controller.10 Rockwell Automation Publication 1756-PM015E-EN-P - November 2012Chapter 1 Connections Inhibit a ConnectionIn some situations, such as when initially commissioning a system, it is useful to disable portions of a control system and enable them as you wire the control system. The controller lets you inhibit individual modules or groups of modules, which prevents the controller from trying to communicate with the modules. When you configure an I/O module, it defaults to being not inhibited. Y ou can change an individual module’s properties to inhibit a module. When you inhibit a communication bridge module, the controller shuts down the connections to the

The controller lets you inhibit individual modules or groups of modules, which prevents the controller from trying to communicate with the modules. When you configure an I/O module, it defaults to being not inhibited. Y ou can change an individual module’s properties to inhibit a module. When you inhibit a communication bridge module, the controller shuts down the connections to the bridge module and to all the modules that depend on that bridge module. Inhibiting a communication bridge module lets you disable an entire branch of the I/O network. When you inhibit the module, the Controller Organizer displays a yellow attention symbol over the module. ATTENTION: Inhibiting a module breaks the connection to the module and prevents communication of I/O data.

Inhibit a module but a connection to the module was not established (perhaps due to an error condition or fault)The module is inhibited. The module status information changes to indicate that the module is inhibited and not faulted. Uninhibit a module (clear the check box) No fault occurs A connection is ma de to the module and the module is dynamically reconfi gured (if the controller is the owner-controller) with the co nfiguration you created for that module. If the controller is configured for listen-only, it cannot reconfigure the module. Fault occurs A connection is not made to the module.

If so configured, the controller can write the buffered entries to the removable media when its internal buffer becomes 80% full. Additionally, the controller can be commanded to write the buffered entries to the removable media with a message instruction. This procedure is detailed below. Once a log entry is written to the removable media, it is removed from the buffer.

Additionally, the controller can be commanded to write the buffered entries to the removable media with a message instruction. This procedure is detailed below. Once a log entry is written to the removable media, it is removed from the buffer. If the removable media is not present, is full, or if the controller is not configured to automatically write buffered entries to the removable media, and the internal buffer becomes full, entries will continue to be saved in the buffer in a circular fashion. As new entries are stored, the oldest entries will be discarded. Controller Log Files and the Removable Media When written to the removable media, controller logs are stored in plain text files in the T ab Separated Value (TSV) format. Each time the controller writes entries to the CompactFlash card, the entries are appended to the text file until the file reaches 1 MB in size. At this point, the controller creates a new text file. The controller will not attempt to write log entries to a full removable media card. In the event that the removable media becomes full, the system will behave as if the removable media is not present. As controller log files are stored in plain text files in the TSV format, no special tools are required to read them. They can be opened in any text editor, or in a spreadsheet application, such as Microsoft Excel.Rockwell Automation Publication 1756-PM015E-EN-P - November 2012

Automatic Save When the controller's internal log entry buffer becomes 80% full, it can automatically write the buffered entries to the CompactFlash card. Additionally, buffered entries can be automatically written before a firmware update. This is configured by sending a message instruction to the controller, using a message type of “CIP Generic” and a service type of “Controller Log Automatic W rite Set” . Sending a value of 0 will turn off automatic writes, and sending a value of 1 will turn on automatic writes. By default, entries are not automatically written. A rung of logic that performs this configuration and the configuration dialog box of the message instruction are shown below. Figure 2 - Automatic Save

Figure 12 - Log File Location The file will be called ControllerLog_yyy.txt where yyy is a sequential number from 000…999. The log file will be appended to until it reaches a size greater than 1 MB. At that point, the next write of the controller log causes a new file to be created with the next sequence number. Once there are 1000 files larger than 1 MB no more logs will be created. The controller will, however, search for the file name with the smallest possible sequence number that it can create or write to. For example, if a user deletes files 001…100 but leaves the rest, the controller will start creating logs again starting at a sequence number of 001. If there are already 1000 log files and a user deletes log entries out of file 005, the controller will write the next log entries to that file. The controller starts at 000 and looks for the first file that does not exist or is less than 1 MB in size.

For example, even when a status flag is set, an instruction that references that flag is not highlighted. •Y ou cannot define a tag alias to a keyword. Y ou can use these key words. Status of S:FS When the Project Has an SFCThe state of S:FS depends on the status of the SFC. •If you use S:FS in an action of a sequential function chart (SFC), S:FS is set (on) for one scan each time the step goes active. S:FS = step_name .FS. •If the SFC calls a routine, S:FS is set (on) for one scan each time the step that calls the routine goes active. S:FS = step_name .FS.To determine if Use The value you are storing cannot fit into
