HandlingSection VII. Handling and Storage Engineering Controls Personal Protection - The selection of personal protective equipment varies, depending upon conditions of use.For normal application, special ventilation is not necessary. If user's operations generate vapours or mist, use ventilation to keep exposure to airborne contaminants below the exposure limit. Make-up air should always be supplied to balance air removed by exhaust ventilation. Ensure that eyewash station and safety shower are close to work-station. Wear appropriate footwear to prevent product from coming in contact with feet and skin.Section VIII. Exposure Controls/Personal
