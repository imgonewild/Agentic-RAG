Large spill or leak: Absorb with an inert material and put the spilled material in an appropriate waste disposal. Dispose of in accordance with regional regulations. Storage Keep container dry. Keep container tightly closed. Keep in a cool, well-ventilated place.Avoid contamination with reactive substances. After handling, always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. HandlingSection VII. Handling and Storage Engineering Controls Personal Protection - The selection of personal protective equipment varies, depending upon conditions of use.For normal application, special ventilation is not necessary. If user's operations generate vapours or mist, use ventilation to keep exposure to airborne contaminants below the exposure limit. Make-up air should always be supplied to balance air removed by exhaust ventilation. Ensure that eyewash station and safety shower are close to work-station. Wear appropriate footwear to prevent product from coming in contact with feet and skin.Section VIII.

Section XIII. Disposal Considerations Waste Disposal Preferred waste management priorities are: (1) recycle or reprocess; (2) incineration with energy recovery; (3) disposal at licensed waste disposal facility. Ensure that disposal or reprocessing is in compliance with government requirements and local disposal regulations. Consult your local or regional authorities. Section XIV.
