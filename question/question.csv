What is the purpose of the CompactFlash card in Logix5000 controllers?	It is used to store log files and other data for later review and backup.
What is a major fault in the controller and how is it triggered?	"A major fault is a critical error that stops the controller・s operation, often triggered by loss of connection to a critical module."
How do you configure a major fault to occur in the controller?	You can set modules to generate a major fault if they lose connection to the controller.
What is an SFC (Sequential Function Chart) in Logix5000 controllers?	"It is a graphical language used for programming control sequences, especially useful for managing complex operations."
How are controller logs stored?	Logs are stored as plain text files in Tab Separated Value (TSV) format on removable media like a CompactFlash card.
What kind of media can Logix5000 controllers write logs to?	Logs can be written to a CompactFlash card or other supported removable media depending on the controller model.
How does the controller handle a loss of communication with a module?	"If communication is lost, the controller operates based on the last received data from the module, unless configured otherwise."
What is the Change Detection feature in Logix5000 controllers?	"Change Detection monitors changes made to the controller, such as configuration edits, and updates the AuditValue accordingly."
What is the role of the GSV instruction in Change Detection?	"The GSV retrieves the current Change Detection settings or values, such as the AuditValue."
How do you inhibit a module using logic?	"By using GSV and SSV instructions to manipulate the Mode attribute, you can inhibit or uninhibit a module from logic."
What does the attribute ．FaultCode・ indicate?	"It indicates a fault code related to a specific module, showing whether communication or operation issues have occurred."
What does ．Total Entry Count・ indicate in the Controller Log?	It tracks the total number of log entries added since the last firmware update.
How can you reset the Execution Modification Count?	The Execution Modification Count can be reset using the Set System Value (SSV) instruction.
What does the 'LEDStatus' attribute monitor?	"It monitors the state of the I/O status indicator on the front of the controller, indicating module communication status."
What happens when you enable automatic log writes?	Buffered entries are automatically written to the removable media when the internal buffer reaches 80% capacity.
How can you convert memory information from INTs to DINT?	You use the Copy (COP) instruction to convert the lower and upper 16 bits into a 32-bit DINT value.
What is the purpose of the ．Modify Execution Count・?	"It tracks modifications that affect the controller・s execution, such as online edits or changes to force settings."
What does the ．System Overhead Time Slice・ modify?	It adjusts the percentage of controller time allocated to communication and system tasks.
What happens if you remove the CompactFlash card during logging?	"The controller stops writing to removable media, but log entries continue to buffer internally."
How is memory usage viewed in real-time?	The Logix Designer application provides a Memory tab in the Controller Properties that shows actual memory usage.
What is the maximum size of a log file?	Log files can grow up to 1 MB before the controller creates a new file.
What is the ChangesToDetect attribute?	This attribute specifies which events are monitored by the controller for change detection.
How do you write a custom log entry?	A custom log entry can be written using a Message instruction with a user-defined data type for the log description and extended information.
What does a flashing green status indicator on the controller signify?	It signifies that at least one module object is not running.
What type of faults does the Logix5000 controller log?	"It logs major faults, major fault clear events, mode changes, and other significant controller operations."
What kind of changes trigger the AuditValue update?	"Changes such as project downloads, online edits, mode changes, and certain configuration changes trigger an update."
What is the default value of the ChangesToDetect mask?	"The default value is 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, which indicates that all events are monitored."
What events always trigger an AuditValue update?	Events like project downloads or changes to the ChangesToDetect configuration always trigger an update.
How do you retrieve system data from a controller?	System data is retrieved using the Get System Value (GSV) instruction.
How can you estimate controller memory offline?	You can estimate memory usage by viewing the Memory tab in the Controller Properties of the Logix Designer application.
What does the 'Program properties modified' log entry record?	"It records changes to a program・s properties, such as the main routine or fault routine."
How do you monitor communication health for a specific device?	The GSV instruction can retrieve the 'FaultCode' for the specific device to check its communication status.
How are buffered log entries written to removable media?	Buffered entries are written when the buffer reaches 80% capacity or when triggered by a Message instruction.
What is the role of the Major Fault Handler?	It handles faults that interrupt the execution of logic and can either clear the fault or shut down the controller.
How can you estimate the largest contiguous block of memory?	Use a Message (MSG) instruction configured to retrieve memory information and identify the largest free memory block.
What happens if the controller buffer is full?	The controller overwrites the oldest log entries in a circular fashion unless the entries are written to removable media.
What does the attribute ．Free I/O Memory・ indicate?	It indicates the amount of available memory dedicated to I/O tags in the controller.
What does a major fault code 3/16 signify?	It indicates that a required I/O module connection failed while the controller was in Run mode.
How do you configure the controller to save logs automatically?	Automatic log saving is configured via a Message instruction with the ：Controller Log Automatic Write Set； service.
What happens if the CompactFlash card is full?	The controller stops writing logs to the card and behaves as if the card is not present.
What are produced and consumed tags used for?	"They are used for communication between controllers, allowing them to share real-time data."
What does a ．Correlation Affected・ event mean?	It indicates that changes occurred in the controller that affect the synchronization between the controller and the downloaded project file.
What is the purpose of the ．Execute Modification Count・?	
How do you configure change detection programmatically?
